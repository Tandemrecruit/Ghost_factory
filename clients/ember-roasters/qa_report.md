FAIL: [Multiple visual issues detected]

1. **Text Readability Issues:**
   - Several sections show text that appears to have insufficient contrast or visibility
   - Some body text appears faint or difficult to read against its background
   - Multiple instances of small text that may be hard to parse on mobile

2. **Layout Concerns:**
   - Several sections appear to have inconsistent spacing and alignment
   - Some text blocks appear cramped or have awkward line breaks
   - Potential overflow issues with longer text content on narrow viewports

3. **Button/CTA Visibility:**
   - Primary CTA buttons (blue buttons) are visible, but secondary CTAs have unclear prominence
   - Some buttons appear to blend into surrounding elements
   - Call-to-action hierarchy is unclear in several sections

4. **Professional Appearance:**
   - Color contrast in some sections (particularly dark backgrounds with certain text colors) needs improvement
   - Inconsistent typography scaling across sections
   - Some text appears to have low contrast against blue/dark backgrounds

5. **Potential Invisible Text:**
   - Dark blue backgrounds with dark text in several sections suggest possible contrast issues
   - Text on colored backgrounds (blue sections) appears to have marginal contrast ratios
   - Some descriptive text may be difficult to read without careful examination

**Recommendation:** Review color contrast ratios (aim for WCAG AA compliance minimum 4.5:1 for body text), increase spacing between elements, and ensure all text maintains adequate legibility across the mobile viewport.
