# Project Brief: Ember Roasters Subscription Landing Page

## Overview

Ember Roasters is a Portland-based coffee roastery launching a direct-to-consumer subscription service targeting quality-conscious home brewers aged 28–45. The landing page needs to convert visitors into subscribers by emphasizing freshness (weekly roasting), direct farm relationships, and approachable expertise—all while maintaining a warm, unpretentious tone that differentiates from both mass-market and overly precious specialty brands. The page will drive traffic to Shopify checkout with a primary focus on subscription signups and secondary option for one-time purchases.

## Brand Colors

- **Primary**: Deep burgundy/maroon (hero backgrounds, primary buttons, headlines)
- **Secondary**: Cream/off-white (page backgrounds, text on dark sections)
- **Accent**: Burnt orange (highlights, secondary CTAs, iconography, hover states)
- **Supporting**: Consider adding a dark espresso brown for body text and a soft gray for subtle UI elements

## Layout Strategy

### Section 1: Hero
**Purpose**: Immediate emotional connection + primary conversion opportunity

- Full-width hero with warm, lifestyle-oriented imagery (steaming cup, morning light, home brewing ritual)
- Headline: Lead with the feeling, not the product feature
- Subhead: Introduce the freshness promise and subscription concept
- Primary CTA: "Start Your Subscription" (burgundy button)
- Secondary link: "Or try a single bag" (text link)
- Trust indicator: Small roast date badge or "Ships within 48 hours of roasting"

**Rationale**: Coffee is sensory and emotional. The hero should evoke the ritual and warmth before explaining logistics. The immediate CTA captures high-intent visitors while the secondary option reduces friction for hesitant buyers.

---

### Section 2: Social Proof Bar
**Purpose**: Establish credibility and borrowed trust

- Horizontal strip with cream/light background
- Format: "As featured in..." or logo lockup style
- Include: Press mentions, notable reviews, or aggregate stats (e.g., "10,000+ subscribers," "4.9★ average rating")
- Keep minimal—logos only or very short quote snippets

**Rationale**: Coming immediately after the hero, this validates the brand before asking visitors to invest mental energy in learning more. Particularly important for a newer D2C brand competing with established names like Blue Bottle.

---

### Section 3: How It Works
**Purpose**: Demystify the subscription model and reduce friction

- Three-step horizontal layout with icons
- Step 1: "Choose Your Plan" (tier selection)
- Step 2: "We Roast Fresh" (weekly small-batch roasting)
- Step 3: "Delivered to Your Door" (free shipping, roast date on bag)
- Optional: Small animation or illustrated icons in burnt orange

**Rationale**: Subscription models create cognitive load. By immediately clarifying the simple process, we reduce anxiety and make the commitment feel manageable. This section answers "how does this actually work?" before it becomes an objection.

---

### Section 4: Why Ember (Features/Benefits)
**Purpose**: Differentiate through quality story without being pretentious

- Three-column feature grid with icons
- **Roasted Fresh Weekly**: "Every batch roasted to order. Every bag stamped with its roast date. No shelf-sitting, ever."
- **Direct From Farmers**: "We work directly with farms in Ethiopia, Colombia, and Guatemala—fair prices for them, exceptional coffee for you."
- **Stupid-Simple Subscription**: "Pause anytime. Cancel anytime. No contracts, no commitments, no hassle."

**Rationale**: These three pillars address the core value propositions while preemptively handling objections (staleness, ethics, commitment fear). The language stays warm and conversational per brand voice.

---

### Section 5: Our Coffee Origins
**Purpose**: Build desire through story and sensory language

- Visual-forward section with photography of origin farms/farmers
- Brief narratives for each sourcing region (Ethiopia, Colombia, Guatemala)
- Flavor profile hints without being overly technical
- Could include a subtle rotating/carousel element or static grid

**Rationale**: Origin story creates emotional connection and justifies premium pricing. This is where we compete with Blue Bottle's narrative without matching their sometimes-exclusionary tone. Focus on the humans and the craft, not the jargon.

---

### Section 6: Subscription Tiers (Pricing)
**Purpose**: Clear tier presentation with value anchoring

- Three-card layout with pricing comparison
- **Explorer** – $24/mo: 12oz bag, perfect for casual drinkers
- **Enthusiast** – $42/mo: 2 × 12oz bags, most popular (highlight this tier)
- **Obsessed** – $72/mo: 4 × 12oz bags + exclusive micro-lots

**Each card includes**:
- Monthly price
- Per-cup breakdown (e.g., "~$0.50/cup")
- What's included
- "Free shipping" badge
- CTA button: "Choose Explorer" / "Choose Enthusiast" / "Choose Obsessed"

**Value anchoring**: Compare to daily coffee shop spend ("Less than your weekly latte habit")

**Rationale**: The "Enthusiast" tier should be visually emphasized as the anchor—it's the psychological middle option most will select. Per-cup pricing directly addresses the "too expensive" objection by reframing value.

---

### Section 7: Testimonials
**Purpose**: Social proof through real customer voices

- 2-3 customer testimonials with photos (if available)
- Focus on: taste quality, freshness difference, subscription convenience, customer service
- Include name, location, and subscription tier if possible
- Consider a carousel or static grid depending on quantity

**Rationale**: Peer validation is critical for subscription conversion. Testimonials should feel authentic and specific—avoid generic "great coffee!" quotes in favor of stories about brewing rituals or the freshness difference.

---

### Section 8: Our Story
**Purpose**: Human connection and brand differentiation

- Split layout: imagery of roastery/founders + narrative text
- Origin story: Why they started, Portland roots, obsession with freshness
- Keep it brief (2-3 paragraphs max)
- Tone: Passionate but not precious. "We're coffee nerds, but we promise not to be annoying about it."

**Rationale**: D2C brands thrive on founder story. This section builds trust and likability, differentiating from faceless corporations. Position after pricing so it reinforces decision rather than delaying it.

---

### Section 9: FAQ
**Purpose**: Objection handling and practical information

**Recommended questions**:
- How fresh is the coffee when it arrives?
- Can I pause or cancel my subscription?
- What if I don't like the coffee I receive?
- Do you ship nationwide? How much is shipping?
- Can I customize my subscription (roast level, frequency)?
- How is your coffee sourced?

**Format**: Accordion-style for scannability, burgundy headers, cream background

**Rationale**: FAQs serve dual purpose—answering genuine questions and handling unspoken objections. Every answer should reassure and reduce friction toward conversion.

---

### Section 10: Final CTA
**Purpose**: Last conversion opportunity with urgency-appropriate messaging

- Full-width section with burgundy background
- Headline: Reinforce the transformation ("Your Best Mornings Start Here")
- Subhead: Satisfaction guarantee reminder
- Primary CTA: "Start Your Subscription"
- Secondary: "Try a single bag first"
- Trust badges: Satisfaction guarantee, free shipping, cancel anytime

**Rationale**: For visitors who've scrolled the entire page, this is the decision point. Remove all remaining friction with guarantee emphasis and flexible options.
