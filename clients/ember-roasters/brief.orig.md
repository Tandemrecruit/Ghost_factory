# Project Brief: Ember Roasters Subscription Landing Page

## Overview

Ember Roasters is a Portland-based specialty coffee roastery launching a direct-to-consumer subscription page targeting quality-focused home brewers aged 28–45. The page must convert visitors into monthly subscribers by emphasizing freshness (weekly roasts with visible roast dates), ethical sourcing from specific origins, and the convenience of never running out of exceptional coffee. The warm, artisan brand voice should make premium coffee feel accessible rather than pretentious.

## Brand Colors

- **Primary**: Deep burgundy/maroon — use for primary CTAs, headlines, and key emphasis
- **Secondary**: Burnt orange — use for accents, hover states, and supporting elements
- **Neutral**: Cream/off-white — use for backgrounds and text containers
- **Text**: Deep burgundy on cream backgrounds; cream on burgundy backgrounds

## Layout Strategy

### Section 1: Hero
**Layout**: Full-width image background with left-aligned text overlay

**Content Strategy**:
- Headline: "Coffee Worth Waking Up For" (use existing tagline — it's strong)
- Subheadline: "Small-batch, weekly-roasted beans from farms we know by name. Delivered to your door with the roast date on every bag."
- Primary CTA: "Start Your Subscription" (burgundy button)
- Supporting text: "Free shipping. Pause or cancel anytime."

**Visual Direction**: Warm morning light, steam rising from a pour-over or fresh bag being opened. Avoid sterile studio shots — aim for lived-in, inviting kitchen scenes.

**Rationale**: The tagline does heavy lifting for the morning ritual emotional hook. Subheadline immediately establishes the three key differentiators (small-batch, weekly-roasted, transparent sourcing). "Pause or cancel anytime" defuses commitment anxiety before it forms.

### Section 2: Trust Bar
**Layout**: Horizontal strip, cream background with burgundy text

**Content Strategy**:
- "As Featured In" with Portland Monthly and Willamette Week logos
- Subscriber count when available (e.g., "Join 2,400+ coffee lovers")
- Star rating if available

**Rationale**: Local press mentions resonate with the Portland ethos and signal legitimacy to the quality-focused audience. Placement immediately below hero catches visitors before skepticism sets in.

---

### Section 3: The Ember Difference
**Layout**: Three-column feature grid with icons

**Content Strategy**:

**Column 1 — "Roasted This Week, Not Last Month"**
Every bag ships within days of roasting. We print the roast date right on the label — because freshness isn't a marketing claim, it's a promise you can taste.

**Column 2 — "Farms We Know By Name"**
Direct relationships with growers in Ethiopia, Colombia, and Guatemala. You'll know exactly where your coffee comes from, and so will we.

**Column 3 — "Never Run Out Again"**
Your subscription arrives like clockwork. Adjust frequency, pause for vacation, or cancel anytime. No contracts, no guilt.

**Rationale**: Each column directly addresses a core benefit while subtly handling objections. "Roast date on the label" is a tangible proof point that competitors can't fake. Naming specific countries builds credibility over vague "ethically sourced" claims.

---

### Section 4: How It Works
**Layout**: Horizontal three-step process with numbered icons

**Content Strategy**:

1. **Choose Your Plan** — Pick your roast preference and bag quantity
2. **We Roast Fresh** — Your beans are roasted the week they ship
3. **Coffee Arrives** — Free shipping, right to your door

**CTA**: "Choose Your Plan" (scroll to pricing)

**Rationale**: Simplifying the subscription mental model reduces friction. Three steps feels manageable; more feels like work.

---

### Section 5: Meet Your Origins
**Layout**: Image-led section with origin cards or horizontal scroll

**Content Strategy**:
- Brief story-driven copy about the three origin countries
- Ethiopia: "Bright, fruity, and complex — from the birthplace of coffee"
- Colombia: "Balanced and sweet — our most approachable origin"
- Guatemala: "Rich and chocolatey — for those who like it bold"

**Rationale**: Origin storytelling differentiates from commodity coffee and justifies premium pricing. Tasting notes help subscribers self-select without feeling overwhelmed.

---

### Section 6: Subscription Tiers
**Layout**: Three-column pricing cards, center card highlighted

**Content Strategy**:

| Plan | Price | What's Included | Per-Cup Cost |
|------|-------|-----------------|--------------|
| **Explorer** | $24/mo | 1 bag (12oz), roaster's choice | ~$0.50/cup |
| **Enthusiast** ★ | $42/mo | 2 bags (12oz each), choose your origins | ~$0.44/cup |
| **Obsessed** | $72/mo | 4 bags (12oz each), full origin access + early releases | ~$0.38/cup |

- Highlight "Enthusiast" as most popular (or best value)
- Each card includes CTA: "Start with [Plan Name]"
- Below pricing: "All plans include free shipping. Pause or cancel anytime."

**Per-Cup Anchor**: "That's less than $0.50 per cup — about a third of what you'd pay at a café."

**Rationale**: Per-cup pricing reframes the value conversation and directly addresses the "too expensive" objection. Highlighting the middle tier uses decoy pricing psychology while the top tier establishes quality ceiling.

---

### Section 7: Testimonials
**Layout**: Carousel or grid of 3 testimonial cards

**Content Strategy**:
- Photo + name + subscription tier
- Quote emphasizing freshness, quality, or convenience
- *Placeholder needed — request specific quotes about: taste difference from grocery store coffee, convenience factor, and subscription flexibility*

**Rationale**: Customer proof is essential for subscription conversion. Photos with names and specific tier build authenticity.

---

### Section 8: The Ember Promise
**Layout**: Centered text block with icon, burgundy background

**Content Strategy**:
**Headline**: "Love It or We'll Make It Right"

"If your first bag doesn't make you a believer, we'll replace it free — no questions asked. We're that confident you'll taste the difference."

**Supporting**: "Pause or cancel your subscription anytime. No contracts. No commitments. Just great coffee."

**Rationale**: Explicit risk reversal is critical for subscription conversion. Placing it after pricing catches hesitant visitors before they bounce.

---

### Section 9: FAQ
**Layout**: Accordion-style expandable questions

**Content Strategy**:

**Q: What if I don't like the coffee?**
A: Your first bag comes with our satisfaction guarantee. If it's not for you, we'll replace it free — no questions asked.

**Q: Can I pause or cancel my subscription?**
A: Anytime. No contracts, no cancellation fees. Manage everything from your account in two clicks.

**Q: How fresh is the coffee when it arrives?**
A: We roast every week and ship within days. Every bag has the roast date printed on the label so you know exactly what you're getting.

**Q: Where do you ship?**
A: Everywhere in the USA. All subscriptions include free shipping.

**Q: Can I choose my coffee or is it a surprise?**
A: Both! Explorer subscribers get our roaster's choice (a great way to discover new favorites). Enthusiast and Obsessed subscribers can choose their preferred origins.

**Q: How does billing work?**
A: You're billed monthly on the same date you signed up. You can change your plan, skip a month, or cancel anytime before your next billing date.
