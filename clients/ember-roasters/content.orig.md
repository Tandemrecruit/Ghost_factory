## Meet Your Origins

### 🇪🇹 Ethiopia
**Bright, fruity, and complex — from the birthplace of coffee**

Our Ethiopian beans come from smallholder farms in Yirgacheffe, where coffee grows wild in the shade of native trees. Expect notes of blueberry, jasmine, and citrus in every cup. This is coffee that tastes like nowhere else on earth.

### 🇨🇴 Colombia
**Balanced and sweet — our most approachable origin**

From the high-altitude farms of Huila, these beans deliver everything you love about great coffee without the guesswork. Caramel sweetness, nutty depth, and a clean finish that works beautifully in any brewing method.

### 🇬🇹 Guatemala
**Rich and chocolatey — for those who like it bold**

Volcanic soil and cool mountain air create beans with serious body and complexity. Think dark chocolate, toasted almond, and a hint of spice. This is the coffee that stands up to milk and keeps you coming back for another cup.

## What Subscribers Are Saying

### "I didn't know coffee could taste like this"

"After years of buying whatever was on sale at the grocery store, Ember showed me what I was missing. The difference is night and day — and having it show up at my door means I actually drink great coffee every morning, not just on special occasions."

**— Michael T., Enthusiast subscriber**

---

### "The convenience is incredible"

"I travel for work and used to panic-buy coffee at the airport or settle for hotel room packets. Now I just pause my subscription when I'm gone and restart it when I'm back. It's so simple, and I never run out anymore."

**— Sarah K., Explorer subscriber**

---

### "Worth every penny"

"I did the math — I was spending $45/week at my local coffee shop. Now I spend $42/month and drink better coffee at home. Plus I know exactly where my beans come from and when they were roasted. Ember spoiled me in the best way."

**— James L., Obsessed subscriber**

**How fresh is the coffee when it arrives?**

We roast every week and ship within days. Every bag has the roast date printed on the label so you know exactly what you're getting. Most grocery store coffee was roasted weeks or even months ago. Yours? Less than a week old when it hits your doorstep.

**Where do you ship?**

Everywhere in the USA. All subscriptions include free shipping, whether you're in Portland or Portland (Maine). We pack your beans in heat-sealed bags with one-way valves to lock in freshness during transit.

---

**Can I choose my coffee or is it a surprise?**

Both! Explorer subscribers get our roaster's choice — a great way to discover new favorites and trust our expertise. Enthusiast and Obsessed subscribers can choose their preferred origins each month. Want all Ethiopia? You got it. Prefer variety? Mix and match to your heart's content.

---

**How does billing work?**

You're billed monthly on the same date you signed up. You can change your plan, skip a month, or cancel anytime before your next billing date. No surprise charges. No auto-renewals you forgot about. Just straightforward billing that puts you in control.

---

**What's the difference between the plans?**

All plans get the same exceptional quality and freshness. Explorer gives you one bag of our choice — perfect for individuals or anyone who wants to be surprised. Enthusiast doubles the coffee and lets you pick origins — ideal for couples or heavier drinkers. Obsessed is for those who go through coffee quickly or want to stock up, plus you get first access to limited releases and experimental roasts.

---

**What if I need more (or less) coffee?**

Change your plan anytime. Need an extra bag this month because guests are coming? Add it. Want to downsize for a while? Switch tiers. Your subscription works for your life, not the other way around.
