## Why Ember

### Section Heading
**Why Coffee Nerds (and Regular Humans) Choose Ember**

### Feature 1: Roasted Fresh Weekly
**No Shelf-Sitters Allowed**

Most grocery store coffee was roasted months ago. Ours? Days ago. Every batch is roasted to order, and every bag is stamped with its roast date. You'll taste the difference in that first sip—brighter, more complex, actually fresh. Because coffee is produce, not a pantry staple.

### Feature 2: Direct From Farmers
**Good for Them, Exceptional for You**

We work directly with farming families in Ethiopia, Colombia, and Guatemala—cutting out the middlemen and paying fair prices. Better relationships mean better coffee. You get exceptional beans with actual stories, and farmers get the sustainability to invest in next year's harvest.

### Feature 3: Stupid-Simple Subscription
**Zero Commitment, Zero Hassle**

Pause when you're traveling. Cancel if you want. Change your plan or frequency whenever. No contracts, no phone calls, no "are you sure?" guilt trips. We're confident you'll stick around because the coffee's that good—not because we've trapped you.

## Our Coffee Origins

### Section Heading
**Meet Your Coffee**

### Origin 1: Ethiopia – Yirgacheffe
**Where It All Began**

Bright, floral, almost tea-like. Our Ethiopian beans come from smallholder farmers in Yirgacheffe, where coffee grows wild in the highlands. Expect notes of bergamot, jasmine, and stone fruit. This is coffee that tastes like sunshine feels.

**Partners:** Kebel Cooperative • Altitude: 1,900-2,200m

### Origin 2: Colombia – Huila
**Balanced & Beloved**

Smooth, chocolatey, crowd-pleasing. From the mountains of Huila, these beans are grown by third-generation farmers who know their craft. Rich caramel sweetness with a bright citrus finish. This is the coffee that makes everyone happy.

**Partners:** Finca El Paraíso • Altitude: 1,600-1,850m

### Origin 3: Guatemala – Antigua
**Bold & Complex**

Full-bodied with a satisfying richness. Antigua's volcanic soil produces coffee with deep chocolate notes, hints of spice, and a velvety texture. This is your "I need to focus" morning coffee or your "I deserve this" afternoon ritual.

**Partners:** Bella Vista Estate • Altitude: 1,500-1,700m

## Our Story

### Section Heading
**We're Coffee Nerds (But We Promise Not to Be Annoying About It)**

### Story Copy
Ember Roasters started in 2019 in a tiny Portland warehouse when founder Maya Chen couldn't find coffee that was both exceptional *and* unpretentious. Too much specialty coffee culture felt exclusive—like you needed a degree in coffee science just to order a bag. Meanwhile, mass-market coffee tasted like, well, nothing.

So we built something different. A roastery obsessed with freshness, direct farmer relationships, and actual flavor—without the gatekeeping. We roast small batches every week, work directly with farming families who care as much about quality as we do, and ship beans while they're still singing.

We're here for the ritual of morning coffee, the comfort of a perfect cup, and the simple joy of something made with care. Whether you're brewing pourover at 6am or just need fuel to survive Monday, you deserve better than stale beans.

**Welcome to Ember. Let's make your mornings better.**

## FAQ

### Section Heading
**Questions? We've Got Answers.**

---

**How fresh is the coffee when it arrives?**

Extremely fresh. We roast every Monday and ship orders within 48 hours of roasting. Your coffee typically arrives 2-4 days after roasting (depending on your location), and every bag is stamped with its roast date. For reference, most grocery store coffee was roasted 3-6 months before it hits shelves. Freshness matters—a lot.

---

**Can I pause or cancel my subscription?**

Absolutely. Log into your account anytime to pause, skip a delivery, or cancel. No phone calls, no hassles, no "are you sure?" guilt trips. We want you to stay because you love the coffee, not because we've made it difficult to leave.

---

**What if I don't like the coffee I receive?**

We'll make it right. If you're not happy with your order, email us within 30 days and we'll send a replacement or issue a full refund—your choice. We're confident you'll love our coffee, but if something's off, we want to know.

---

**Do you ship nationwide? How much is shipping?**

We ship to all 50 states, and shipping is always free on subscriptions. One-time purchases get free shipping on orders over $30. We ship via USPS Priority Mail, so most orders arrive within 2-3 business days.

---

**Can I customize my subscription?**

Yes! You can:
- Choose specific origins or get our rotating selection
- Adjust frequency (weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly)
- Mix and match different coffees in multi-bag plans
- Change your plan level anytime
- Add one-time purchases to any subscription order

Just log into your account to make changes.

---

**How is your coffee sourced?**

We work directly with farming families and cooperatives in Ethiopia, Colombia, and Guatemala—relationships we've built over years, not transactions with brokers. We pay well above Fair Trade minimums, visit farms regularly, and prioritize long-term partnerships that let farmers invest in quality and sustainability. Every bean has a story, and we're happy to share it.

---

**What roast levels do you offer?**

Most of our coffees are light-to-medium roasts that highlight origin characteristics—bright, complex, and flavorful without being sour or overly acidic. We believe great beans deserve roasting that showcases their natural qualities rather than covering them up. If you prefer darker roasts, our Guatemala Antigua has more body and richness.

---

**What grind should I choose?**

We recommend ordering whole beans and grinding fresh at home for maximum flavor, but we're happy to grind for you. Options include:
- Whole bean (our recommendation)
- Coarse (French press, cold brew)
- Medium (drip coffee makers)
- Fine (espresso machines, Aeropress)

Select your preference at checkout or in your subscription settings.
