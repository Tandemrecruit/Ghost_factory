## Features / Benefits Section

### Section Headline
**Three Things We'll Never Compromise On**

### Feature 1: Roasted Fresh, Weekly
**Icon suggestion:** Calendar with coffee bean

Every bag leaves our roastery within days of roastingâ€”not weeks or months. You'll see the exact roast date printed on every package, guaranteeing you're brewing coffee at its peak flavor window.

No stale beans. No mystery dates. Just coffee the way it's meant to taste.

### Feature 2: Sourced Direct from Farmers
**Icon suggestion:** Globe or handshake

We work directly with small farms in Ethiopia, Colombia, and Guatemalaâ€”building relationships that let us secure exceptional beans while ensuring farmers get paid fairly.

You get better coffee. They get a better deal. Everyone wins.

### Feature 3: Free Shipping, Always
**Icon suggestion:** Delivery box

All subscription orders ship free, every single time. No minimums. No surprises at checkout. Just fresh coffee showing up like clockwork.

Because a $7 shipping charge shouldn't stand between you and great coffee.

## Sourcing Story Section

### Section Headline
**The Beans Behind Your Brew**

### Body Copy
Great coffee starts long before we fire up the roaster. It starts with farmers who care as much about quality as we do.

We've spent years building direct relationships with small farms in Ethiopia's Yirgacheffe region, Colombia's coffee-growing mountains, and the volcanic soils of Guatemala. These aren't transactional relationshipsâ€”we return to the same farms season after season, working together to improve quality and ensure everyone gets paid fairly.

When you cut out the middlemen and work directly with producers, something magic happens: farmers can focus on quality over quantity, and you get beans that actually taste like something.

Every origin we source tells a story. Every bag we roast honors the people who grew it.

**No jargon. No pretension. Just honest coffee from people who give a damn.**

### Supporting Element (3 origin cards)

**Ethiopia â€” Yirgacheffe**  
Bright, floral, complex. The birthplace of coffee.

**Colombia â€” Huila**  
Balanced, sweet, classic. Crowd-pleaser for a reason.

**Guatemala â€” Antigua**  
Rich, chocolatey, bold. Built for morning rituals.

## FAQ Section

### Section Headline
**Questions We Get Asked A Lot**

---

**How fresh is "fresh," really?**

We roast every Monday and Thursday. Most subscriptions ship within 2-3 days of roasting, and you'll receive your coffee within a week of the roast date. Every bag is clearly marked so you know exactly how fresh your beans are.

Compare that to grocery store coffee (often 3-6 months old) or even other "specialty" subscriptions (2-4 weeks old). The difference in taste is dramatic.

---

**Is this actually cheaper than my daily coffee shop run?**

Let's do the math: Our Enthusiast plan breaks down to about $0.50 per cup. If you're buying one $5 latte daily, you're spending $150/month. Even cutting that to 3x weekly is $60/monthâ€”and you're still drinking better coffee at home with our subscription.

---

**Can I really cancel anytime? What's the catch?**

Really. No catch. Log into your account, click "cancel," done. We'd rather you come back on your own terms than feel trapped. Coffee should make you happy, not stressed.

You can also pause deliveries if you're traveling or drowning in beansâ€”we get it.

---

**What if I don't like the coffee?**

If your first bag doesn't meet your expectations, reach out. We'll send a replacement free, or refund you completely. We're confident you'll love it, but if you don't, we want to make it right.

---

**How do you ship? How long does it take?**

We ship via USPS Priority Mail. Most orders arrive within 2-4 business days. You'll get tracking info as soon as your order ships.

All subscription orders ship freeâ€”that's our promise.

---

**Can I choose which origins I receive?**

Explorer subscribers get our featured monthly selections. Enthusiast and Obsessed subscribers can customize their origin choices through your account dashboard. Or just let us surprise youâ€”we're pretty good at this.

---

**What brewing methods work best?**

Our coffee is roasted to shine across all brewing methods: pour-over, French press, drip, espresso, AeroPressâ€”you name it. We provide brewing tips with each order, but honestly, good beans are pretty forgiving.

---

**Do you offer decaf?**

Not yet, but we're working on sourcing a decaf that meets our quality standards. It's harder than you'd think. Join our email list and we'll let you know when we nail it.

---

**What's a "micro-lot" and why should I care?**

Micro-lots are small-batch, ultra-premium coffeesâ€”think limited harvest from a specific section of a farm. They're often experimental varieties or special processing methods. 

Enthusiast and Obsessed subscribers get early or exclusive access to these when we source them. They're special, and they don't last long.
