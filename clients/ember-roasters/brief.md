## Strategic Notes

1. **Avoid elitism:** The brand voice is "unpretentious"â€”copy should feel welcoming, not exclusive. Think neighborhood roaster, not coffee snob.

2. **Lead with freshness:** The roast-date guarantee is a key differentiator. Make it visible and concrete.

3. **Price anchoring:** Position the per-cup cost ($0.50) early to reframe the subscription price against daily coffee shop spending.

4. **Low-risk entry:** The satisfaction guarantee and flexible cancellation are powerful objection-bustersâ€”feature them prominently near CTAs.

5. **No false urgency:** Per client instructions, avoid countdown timers or artificial scarcity. The value proposition should stand on its own.
