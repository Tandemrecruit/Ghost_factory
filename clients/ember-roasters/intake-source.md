# Raw Client Notes - Ember Roasters

hey so we're a coffee roastery in portland oregon, been around since 2019. we roast small batch specialty coffee and sell direct to consumers and some local cafes. 

our name is Ember Roasters and our tagline is "Coffee Worth Waking Up For" 

we dont have a website right now just instagram @emberroasterspdx

main thing we want is to sell our subscription boxes - people sign up and get fresh roasted beans delivered monthly. we also sell one-time bags but the subscriptions are the money maker

our customers are mostly 28-45 year olds who care about quality coffee and are willing to pay more for it. they're the type who have a nice pour over setup at home or an espresso machine. not the folgers crowd lol

brand vibe is: warm, artisan, unpretentious, quality-obsessed

we want people to sign up for subscriptions mainly. secondary would be one-time purchases.

colors we use: deep burgundy/maroon, cream/off-white, and a burnt orange accent. very cozy autumn vibes

benefits:
- beans roasted fresh weekly (not sitting on shelves for months)
- we source directly from farmers in ethiopia, colombia, guatemala 
- every bag has roast date printed on it
- free shipping on subscriptions

objections people have:
1. "subscription coffee is too expensive" - actually works out to like $0.50/cup which is way less than starbucks
2. "what if i dont like it" - we have a satisfaction guarantee, first bag free replacement
3. "i dont want to commit" - can pause or cancel anytime, no contracts

we want a hero section, features/benefits, maybe testimonials (i can get you some quotes from customers), pricing section showing the 3 subscription tiers, and a FAQ

subscription tiers:
- Explorer ($24/mo) - 12oz bag
- Enthusiast ($42/mo) - two 12oz bags  
- Obsessed ($72/mo) - four 12oz bags + exclusive micro-lots

CTA should be "Start Your Subscription" and go to our shopify checkout

we service all of USA, free shipping included

competitors/inspo: Blue Bottle, Counter Culture, Onyx Coffee - but we want to feel more approachable/less pretentious than blue bottle

no specific legal stuff, just need to mention the satisfaction guarantee

timeline: would love to have something up in 2 weeks, not super urgent

OH also we have some press - featured in Portland Monthly magazine and Willamette Week

thats pretty much it! let me know if you need anything else
