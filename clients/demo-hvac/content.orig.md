## Services We Offer

### AC Installation & Replacement
Time for a new system? We'll assess your home, explain your options clearly, and install a unit that fits your budget and cooling needs. No confusing jargon — just honest advice about what makes sense for your house and your family.

### Furnace Repair & Replacement
Whether it's a minor fix or time for a new furnace, we'll give you honest recommendations — not a hard sell. We've repaired 20-year-old furnaces and installed brand-new systems. We'll tell you which option makes the most sense for you.

### Spring AC Tune-Up
Get your AC ready before the heat hits. A quick tune-up catches small problems before they become expensive repairs. We'll clean, inspect, and make sure everything's running efficiently — so you're not caught off guard during the first heat wave.

### Fall Furnace Check
Our seasonal inspection includes a carbon monoxide safety check, so your family stays warm and safe all winter. We'll test all the important stuff, replace your filter, and let you know if anything needs attention before the cold weather arrives.

### Emergency No-Heat Service
Furnace quit on the coldest night? We offer same-day emergency service to get your heat back fast. We know you can't wait until next Tuesday when it's 15 degrees outside — we'll prioritize your call and get someone out quickly.

### Indoor Air Quality
From air purifiers to humidity control, we can help improve the air your family breathes every day. If you've noticed more dust, dry air in winter, or allergies acting up at home, we can suggest solutions that actually work.

## Why Sterling Heights Homeowners Call Us

### Upfront, Honest Pricing
We give you clear options — good, better, best — with pricing you see before we start. No surprise fees, no pressure. You'll know exactly what you're paying for and why. If something unexpected comes up, we'll explain it and get your approval before proceeding.

### Local Crew, Familiar Faces
We're not a franchise or a 1-800 number. When you call, you talk to real people who live and work in this community. When we visit, you'll see the same trusted technicians — not a different stranger every time. We're your neighbors, not a call center three states away.

### We Fix What Needs Fixing
Not every problem needs a new system. We'll tell you honestly whether a repair makes sense or it's time to replace — and explain why. If your 8-year-old AC just needs a $200 part, we're not going to tell you to spend $5,000 on a new unit. But if you're looking at the third expensive repair on a 20-year-old system, we'll explain when replacement becomes the smarter investment.

### On-Time, Every Time
Your time matters. We show up when we say we will and keep you informed if anything changes. You'll get a call when we're on our way, and if we're running late (it happens), you'll know ahead of time. No waiting around all day wondering when we'll arrive.

## How It Works

### Step 1 — Call or Schedule Online
Give us a call at **(586) XXX-XXXX** or fill out our quick online form. We'll find a time that works for your schedule — including evenings and weekends when needed. We'll also let you know what to expect during the visit.

### Step 2 — We Inspect & Explain
Our technician assesses the situation, explains what's going on in plain English, and gives you options. We'll show you what we're seeing, answer your questions, and provide clear pricing for each solution. Take your time — we're not here to rush you.

### Step 3 — You Decide, We Deliver
Choose what works for you — no pressure, no sales tactics. We complete the work carefully, clean up after ourselves, and make sure you're comfortable with everything before we leave. You'll also get straightforward advice on maintenance so you can avoid future problems.

## Safety & Peace of Mind

### Your Family's Safety Is Part of Every Visit

Every furnace inspection includes a carbon monoxide check. It's not about scaring you — it's about making sure your home is as safe as it is comfortable. 

Carbon monoxide is invisible and odorless, and a cracked heat exchanger or blocked vent can create a dangerous situation without you knowing. We test during every visit because it takes two minutes and could save your family's life. If we find an issue, we'll explain exactly what it is, why it matters, and what your options are to fix it safely.

Peace of mind comes standard with every service call.

## About Comfort Breeze

### Real People, Real Service, Real Commitment to This Community

Comfort Breeze Heating & Air is a family-owned HVAC company based right here in Sterling Heights. We're not the biggest operation in Metro Detroit, and that's by design.

We started this business because we were tired of seeing homeowners treated like transaction numbers — pressured into unnecessary replacements, hit with surprise charges, or left waiting for service trucks that never showed up on time. 

We believe you deserve better than that. You deserve clear answers, honest recommendations, and technicians who respect your home and your budget. You deserve to work with people who'll still be here next year when you need your annual tune-up.

Our team lives in the communities we serve. We're licensed and insured professionals who take pride in doing things right — the first time, every time. We don't do high-pressure sales. We don't pad estimates. We don't disappear after the job is done.

We show up on time, explain what's happening with your system in terms you can understand, give you real options at honest prices, and stand behind our work. That's it. That's the whole business model.

**When your heating or cooling isn't working the way it should, we're here to help — honestly, reliably, and without the runaround.**

## Customer Testimonials

### What Sterling Heights Homeowners Are Saying

**"Finally found an HVAC company I can trust"**  
*"Our furnace went out on a Saturday night in January. Comfort Breeze had someone here Sunday morning. The technician was professional, explained everything clearly, and had us back up and running in a couple hours. Price was fair and they didn't try to sell us a new system we didn't need."*  
— **Linda M., Sterling Heights**

**"Honest advice when I needed it most"**  
*"I called three companies about replacing our AC. Two tried to upsell me immediately. Comfort Breeze actually looked at our system, fixed a minor issue for under $200, and said we'd probably get another 3-4 years out of it. That kind of honesty earned my business for life."*  
— **Robert T., Warren**

**"They show up when they say they will"**  
*"Sounds simple, but it's rare. Every appointment has been on time. They call when they're on the way. The same technician has come out twice now and remembers our setup. It's refreshing to work with a local company that actually cares."*  
— **Jennifer K., Troy**

**"No pressure, just options"**  
*"Needed a new furnace and was dreading the sales pitch. The Comfort Breeze team gave me three options at different price points, explained the pros and cons of each, and let me decide. No pressure, no tricks. Installation was clean and professional."*  
— **Mike D., Shelby Township**

**"Peace of mind for my parents"**  
*"I hired Comfort Breeze to do a furnace inspection for my elderly parents. They were patient, thorough, and made sure my mom understood everything. They found a small carbon monoxide concern and fixed it same-day. Can't thank them enough."*  
— **Susan L., Clinton Township**
