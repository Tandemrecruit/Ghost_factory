FAIL: [Text readability issue - partially obscured text. The "Show More" text appears to overlap with or obscure part of the file path text that reads "E:\Desktop\Projects\...\Ghost_factory\..." making it difficult to read the complete file path. The overlay/truncation of this require stack information reduces clarity.]
