FAIL: [Missing images and logos detected]

**Specific Issues:**

1. **Missing Logo/Branding** - No visible company logo at the top of the page where it should be present
2. **Missing Hero Image** - The hero section appears to lack a background image or featured visual
3. **Missing Testimonial Avatars** - Multiple testimonial/review sections show no user profile images or avatars
4. **Missing Illustrative Graphics** - Several content sections have empty spaces where explanatory graphics or icons should be displayed
5. **Missing Feature Icons** - Sections describing features/benefits appear to have placeholder areas without loaded icons

**Additional Observations:**

- Text readability appears acceptable with good contrast on most sections
- Button/CTA visibility is generally good (orange buttons are prominent)
- Layout structure is intact with no obvious broken grid elements
- Overall professional appearance is maintained despite missing visual assets

The page structure and functionality appear sound, but the missing images and logos significantly impact the visual completeness and professional presentation of the site.
