Raw Intake â€“ Local HVAC Company

Business name ideas:
- Current legal: â€œComfort Breeze Heating & Cooling LLCâ€
- What they actually say on the phone: â€œComfort Breeze Heating & Airâ€
- They are okay with either, but like â€œComfort Breeze Heating & Airâ€ for the website.

Owner:
- Mike Ramirez
- 2nd generation HVAC tech
- Started the company 8 years ago after working for a big box contractor he hated
- Wants the site to feel â€œsmall local crew, not a faceless chainâ€

Service area:
- Based in: Sterling Heights, MI
- Target: homeowners within ~30â€“40 minutes
- Mentions these cities: Sterling Heights, Warren, Troy, Shelby Township, Clinton Township
- They DO NOT want to drive into downtown Detroit regularly (okay for special jobs, but not ideal)

Main services (in ownerâ€™s words, kind of messy):
- â€œAC install and changeoutsâ€
- â€œFurnace replacement and repairâ€
- â€œSpring AC tune-upsâ€
- â€œFall furnace checkâ€
- â€œEmergency no-heat calls in winterâ€
- â€œIndoor air quality â€“ filters, humidifiers, UV lights, that kind of thingâ€
- They prefer to highlight: â€œno heatâ€ emergencies in winter + seasonal tune-ups

Biggest customer problems (from call notes):
- â€œMy upstairs is roasting, downstairs is freezingâ€
- â€œSystem runs all day and the bill is insaneâ€
- â€œThe last company never showed up or ghosted usâ€
- â€œWe donâ€™t know if we should repair this dinosaur or replace itâ€
- â€œWeâ€™re nervous about getting scammed, we just want someone honestâ€

What makes them different (owner rant, paraphrased):
- No high-pressure sales â€“ they hate â€œsales guysâ€ in the industry
- Will actually explain options in plain English: â€œgood / better / bestâ€
- Small team, same faces show up each time
- Upfront pricing, no surprise fees at the door
- They will tell people honestly when a repair is fine and replacement isnâ€™t needed yet
- They answer the phone like a real human during business hours (no giant call center)

Ideal customers:
- Homeowners 30â€“65
- Usually families with kids or older parents at home
- Care about comfort + safety, not chasing the absolute cheapest option
- Not DIY people; they want an expert they can trust and call again

Seasonal offers (owner rough notes):
- Spring: â€œAC Tune-Up â€“ keep it from dying on the first 90 degree dayâ€
  - Internal idea: â€œ$89 AC Tune-Upâ€ â€“ they arenâ€™t sure on final price yet
- Fall: Furnace safety check / tune-up
- Winter: â€œNo-Heat Emergencyâ€ page/section â€“ same-day service if possible

PRIMARY GOAL FOR THE LANDING PAGE:
- Owner says: â€œI just want the phone to ring and for people to schedule tune-ups and no-heat calls.â€
- So main CTA: call us + schedule service online
- Secondary CTA: simple form for quote / maintenance plan info

Contact preferences:
- They prefer calls during the day
- Okay with form submissions, but they donâ€™t want a huge long form
- Would like click-to-call buttons on mobile

Brand voice (how they want to sound):
- Straightforward, friendly, not corporate
- â€œTalk like a real person from around here, not a robotâ€
- Slightly informal is fine: â€œWeâ€™ll show up when we say we will.â€
- No scare tactics or fear-mongering, but okay to talk about safety honestly
- Avoid cheesy stuff like â€œyour comfort is our commandâ€ if possible

Visual preferences (rough):
- Colors: blues, maybe a little orange for â€œheat/coolâ€
- No overly dark/black â€œaggressiveâ€ designs
- They like photos that look like real homes and techs, not ultra-polished stock models
- They donâ€™t currently have professional photos, so weâ€™ll probably lean on decent stock for now

Competitor feelings:
- They donâ€™t want to look like:
  - Big chain companies with tons of coupons everywhere
  - Sketchy â€œ$39 tune-upâ€ bait-and-switch ads
- They like:
  - Simple layouts where you can see phone number right away
  - Clear list of services, not overloaded with industry jargon

Random phrases the owner liked during the call:
- â€œNo-pressure HVAC prosâ€
- â€œWe actually show up on timeâ€
- â€œWe fix hot-and-cold roomsâ€
- â€œHonest options, no surprise feesâ€

Things they absolutely do NOT want on the page:
- Fake â€œ4.9 starâ€ graphics with no real source
- Giant price tables comparing 12 different systems
- Stock photos that scream â€œgeneric call centerâ€
- Any mention of â€œnationwideâ€ or â€œserving all of Michiganâ€ â€“ they are local

Notes for page structure (in no particular order, messy on purpose):
- Strong hero: â€œStop sweating and freezing in your own houseâ€ or similar
- Quick bullets on what they do: AC, furnace, tune-ups, emergency no-heat
- Section about â€œWhy homeowners around Sterling Heights call usâ€
- Simple 3-step process: Call â†’ We inspect â†’ You get options
- Short safety-focused line about furnace checks (CO leaks, etc.) but not fear porn
- Highlight that theyâ€™re licensed & insured, local, family-owned
- Clear phone number in header and near main CTAs
- Sticky mobile call button would be nice (note for dev, not copy)
- Optional: mention financing availability for bigger replacements, even if details are basic

Rough CTA ideas (owner words, can be cleaned up later):
- â€œCall now to schedule serviceâ€
- â€œBook your tune-up before the first heat waveâ€
- â€œNeed heat back tonight? Call us now.â€

TODO / Loose ends:
- They still need to confirm final pricing on tune-ups
- They might add maintenance plans later (for now, just a light mention)
- They want to collect reviews later and plug them into the page, but donâ€™t have many yet
