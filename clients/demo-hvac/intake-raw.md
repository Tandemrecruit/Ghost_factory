Raw Intake – Local HVAC Company

Business name ideas:
- Current legal: “Comfort Breeze Heating & Cooling LLC”
- What they actually say on the phone: “Comfort Breeze Heating & Air”
- They are okay with either, but like “Comfort Breeze Heating & Air” for the website.

Owner:
- Mike Ramirez
- 2nd generation HVAC tech
- Started the company 8 years ago after working for a big box contractor he hated
- Wants the site to feel “small local crew, not a faceless chain”

Service area:
- Based in: Sterling Heights, MI
- Target: homeowners within ~30–40 minutes
- Mentions these cities: Sterling Heights, Warren, Troy, Shelby Township, Clinton Township
- They DO NOT want to drive into downtown Detroit regularly (okay for special jobs, but not ideal)

Main services (in owner’s words, kind of messy):
- “AC install and changeouts”
- “Furnace replacement and repair”
- “Spring AC tune-ups”
- “Fall furnace check”
- “Emergency no-heat calls in winter”
- “Indoor air quality – filters, humidifiers, UV lights, that kind of thing”
- They prefer to highlight: “no heat” emergencies in winter + seasonal tune-ups

Biggest customer problems (from call notes):
- “My upstairs is roasting, downstairs is freezing”
- “System runs all day and the bill is insane”
- “The last company never showed up or ghosted us”
- “We don’t know if we should repair this dinosaur or replace it”
- “We’re nervous about getting scammed, we just want someone honest”

What makes them different (owner rant, paraphrased):
- No high-pressure sales – they hate “sales guys” in the industry
- Will actually explain options in plain English: “good / better / best”
- Small team, same faces show up each time
- Upfront pricing, no surprise fees at the door
- They will tell people honestly when a repair is fine and replacement isn’t needed yet
- They answer the phone like a real human during business hours (no giant call center)

Ideal customers:
- Homeowners 30–65
- Usually families with kids or older parents at home
- Care about comfort + safety, not chasing the absolute cheapest option
- Not DIY people; they want an expert they can trust and call again

Seasonal offers (owner rough notes):
- Spring: “AC Tune-Up – keep it from dying on the first 90 degree day”
  - Internal idea: “$89 AC Tune-Up” – they aren’t sure on final price yet
- Fall: Furnace safety check / tune-up
- Winter: “No-Heat Emergency” page/section – same-day service if possible

PRIMARY GOAL FOR THE LANDING PAGE:
- Owner says: “I just want the phone to ring and for people to schedule tune-ups and no-heat calls.”
- So main CTA: call us + schedule service online
- Secondary CTA: simple form for quote / maintenance plan info

Contact preferences:
- They prefer calls during the day
- Okay with form submissions, but they don’t want a huge long form
- Would like click-to-call buttons on mobile

Brand voice (how they want to sound):
- Straightforward, friendly, not corporate
- “Talk like a real person from around here, not a robot”
- Slightly informal is fine: “We’ll show up when we say we will.”
- No scare tactics or fear-mongering, but okay to talk about safety honestly
- Avoid cheesy stuff like “your comfort is our command” if possible

Visual preferences (rough):
- Colors: blues, maybe a little orange for “heat/cool”
- No overly dark/black “aggressive” designs
- They like photos that look like real homes and techs, not ultra-polished stock models
- They don’t currently have professional photos, so we’ll probably lean on decent stock for now

Competitor feelings:
- They don’t want to look like:
  - Big chain companies with tons of coupons everywhere
  - Sketchy “$39 tune-up” bait-and-switch ads
- They like:
  - Simple layouts where you can see phone number right away
  - Clear list of services, not overloaded with industry jargon

Random phrases the owner liked during the call:
- “No-pressure HVAC pros”
- “We actually show up on time”
- “We fix hot-and-cold rooms”
- “Honest options, no surprise fees”

Things they absolutely do NOT want on the page:
- Fake “4.9 star” graphics with no real source
- Giant price tables comparing 12 different systems
- Stock photos that scream “generic call center”
- Any mention of “nationwide” or “serving all of Michigan” – they are local

Notes for page structure (in no particular order, messy on purpose):
- Strong hero: “Stop sweating and freezing in your own house” or similar
- Quick bullets on what they do: AC, furnace, tune-ups, emergency no-heat
- Section about “Why homeowners around Sterling Heights call us”
- Simple 3-step process: Call → We inspect → You get options
- Short safety-focused line about furnace checks (CO leaks, etc.) but not fear porn
- Highlight that they’re licensed & insured, local, family-owned
- Clear phone number in header and near main CTAs
- Sticky mobile call button would be nice (note for dev, not copy)
- Optional: mention financing availability for bigger replacements, even if details are basic

Rough CTA ideas (owner words, can be cleaned up later):
- “Call now to schedule service”
- “Book your tune-up before the first heat wave”
- “Need heat back tonight? Call us now.”

TODO / Loose ends:
- They still need to confirm final pricing on tune-ups
- They might add maintenance plans later (for now, just a light mention)
- They want to collect reviews later and plug them into the page, but don’t have many yet
