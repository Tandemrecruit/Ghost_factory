# Project Brief: Comfort Breeze Heating & Air

## Overview

Comfort Breeze Heating & Air is a small, family-owned residential HVAC company based in Sterling Heights, MI, serving homeowners within approximately 30–40 minutes of their location. Their ideal customers are homeowners aged 30–65 who value comfort, safety, and working with trustworthy local experts rather than DIY solutions. This single-page website will prioritize generating phone calls and online scheduling requests for tune-ups and emergency no-heat service, with messaging that emphasizes their honest, straightforward approach and local presence.

## Brand Colors

Based on client direction of "blues with a splash of orange for heat/cool accents":
- Blues (specific shades to be confirmed with client—suggest a calming medium blue as primary with a darker blue for contrast)
- Orange accent (for heat/energy visual cues and CTA buttons)
- Supporting neutrals to be determined (suggest white/light gray backgrounds, dark gray for text)

*Note: Final color palette should be confirmed with client before development.*

## Layout Strategy

### Section 1: Hero
**Purpose:** Immediately communicate the core promise and drive phone calls

**Layout:**
- Bold headline addressing the pain point directly (e.g., "Stop Sweating and Freezing in Your Own House")
- Subheadline reinforcing trust and locality (e.g., "Your neighbors in Sterling Heights trust Comfort Breeze for honest HVAC service—no surprises, no upsells")
- Primary CTA button: "Call Now to Schedule Service" (phone number to be provided by client)
- Secondary CTA link: "Or Request a Quote Online" (form URL TBD—note to client that this destination needs to be finalized)
- Background: Real photo of technician or local home preferred; avoid generic stock imagery per client direction

**Rationale:** Leading with the emotional pain point ("sweating and freezing") immediately resonates with homeowners experiencing discomfort. The subheadline builds trust before asking for action.

---

### Section 2: Trust Indicators Bar
**Purpose:** Establish immediate credibility without fabricated claims

**Layout:** Horizontal bar with 3–4 trust badges/statements:
- "Licensed & Insured"
- "Family-Owned & Local"
- "Upfront Pricing—No Surprise Fees"
- "Real Humans Answer the Phone"

**Rationale:** These trust signals directly address the objections identified in the intake (price concerns, reliability worries) and are all factual statements confirmed by the client. Notably avoiding any "years in business" claims since founding year was not provided.

---

### Section 3: Services Overview
**Purpose:** Clearly communicate what Comfort Breeze offers

**Layout:** Card-based grid (2x3 or 3x2 depending on screen size) with icons and brief descriptions:

1. **AC Installation & Changeouts** — Efficient cooling systems sized right for your home
2. **Furnace Replacement & Repair** — Reliable heat when Michigan winters hit
3. **Spring AC Tune-Ups** — Get ready before the heat waves arrive
4. **Fall Furnace Checks** — Ensure safe, efficient heating all season
5. **Emergency No-Heat Service** — Same-day response when you need it most
6. **Indoor Air Quality Options** — Cleaner air for healthier homes

**CTA beneath grid:** "Questions about what you need? Call us—we'll explain your options clearly." (phone number to be provided)

**Rationale:** The card format makes services scannable. Brief descriptions focus on outcomes rather than technical jargon, matching the "straightforward, friendly" brand voice.

---

### Section 4: Why Choose Us
**Purpose:** Differentiate from larger competitors and address objections directly

**Layout:** Three-column feature section with icons:

**Column 1: Honest Options, No Pressure**
"We give you good, better, and best choices with upfront pricing. We'll tell you if a repair makes more sense than a replacement—because it's your money, not ours."

**Column 2: Small Crew, Familiar Faces**
"You'll see the same local technicians who know your system. We're not a rotating cast of strangers—we're your neighbors."

**Column 3: We Actually Show Up**
"Real humans answer during business hours. We arrive when we say we will. If something changes, we call you first."

**Rationale:** Each column directly counters the three key objections from the intake: upsell concerns, replace vs. repair anxiety, and reliability/ghosting fears. The conversational tone maintains the "friendly, honest" voice.

---

### Section 5: How It Works (3-Step Process)
**Purpose:** Reduce friction by showing how simple it is to get started

**Layout:** Horizontal 3-step visual with numbered icons:

**Step 1: Call or Request Online**
"Reach out by phone or fill out our quick online form. We'll find a time that works for your schedule."

**Step 2: We Inspect & Explain**
"Our technician arrives on time, diagnoses the issue, and walks you through what we find—no confusing jargon."

**Step 3: You Choose Your Option**
"We present clear choices with upfront pricing. You decide what's right for your home and budget."

**CTA:** "Ready to get started? Call now or schedule online." (phone + form link)

**Rationale:** The simple 3-step format matches the client's explicit request and demystifies the service process. Each step reinforces trust messaging (on-time, clear explanations, your choice).

---

### Section 6: Safety Message
**Purpose:** Communicate the importance of furnace checks without fear-mongering

**Layout:** Single centered block with subtle icon (flame or shield):

**Headline:** "Your Family's Safety Matters"

**Copy:** "A fall furnace tune-up isn't just about comfort—it includes a carbon monoxide check to make sure your system is running safely. It's one of those things that's easy to overlook but important to get right. We handle it as part of every inspection."

**Rationale:** This fulfills the client's requirement for a safety-focused line about CO checks while using a calm, informative tone rather than scare tactics. Positions Comfort Breeze as looking out for customers without being manipulative.

---

### Section 7: Service Area
**Purpose:** Clarify geographic coverage for local SEO and customer qualification

**Layout:** Map graphic or stylized list with surrounding text:

**Headline:** "Proudly Serving Sterling Heights & Surrounding Communities"

**Copy:** "We're based in Sterling Heights and serve homeowners within about 30–40 minutes of our location. Communities we frequently serve include Warren, Troy, Shelby Township, and Clinton Township—if you're nearby, give us a call to confirm we can reach you."

**Note:** Service area does not include downtown Detroit.

**Rationale:** The "give us a call to confirm" phrasing acknowledges that the service radius is approximate (per intake) rather than presenting a definitive boundary. This honest approach matches the brand voice while still providing geographic context for SEO.

---

### Section 8: About / Local Story
**Purpose:** Build personal connection and reinforce "family-owned and local" positioning

**Layout:** Side-by-side image and text block:

**Headline:** "Local, Family-Owned, and Proud of It"

**Copy:** "Comfort Breeze isn't a franchise or a call center. We're a small HVAC team based right here in Sterling Heights. When you call during business hours, you talk to a real person. When we come to your home, you'll see familiar faces who take pride in doing the job right. We believe in straightforward service: show up on time, explain your options clearly, and fix the problem without surprise fees. That's it. No gimmicks, no pressure—just honest work for our neighbors."

**Photo placement:** Real team photo or owner photo preferred (to be provided by client); avoid stock imagery per client direction.

**Rationale:** This section humanizes the business and reinforces multiple trust signals organically. The copy pulls directly from the client's core promise language while maintaining a conversational, local tone.
