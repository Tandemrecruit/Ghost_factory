## Layout Strategy

### Section 1: Hero Section
**Purpose**: Immediately establish relevance, location, and primary action

**Content Elements**:
- **Headline**: "Stop Sweating and Freezing in Your Own House"
- **Subheadline**: "Sterling Heights' trusted HVAC team — on-time service, upfront pricing, no surprises."
- **Primary CTA Button**: "Call Now to Schedule Service" (orange, prominent)
- **Secondary CTA**: "Request a Quote Online" (outlined/ghost button style)
- **Trust micro-copy below CTAs**: "Same-day emergency service available • Licensed & Insured"

**Rationale**: The headline addresses the emotional frustration homeowners feel. Localization in subheadline immediately qualifies the visitor and builds local trust. Dual CTAs accommodate both phone-first and form-preference visitors.

### Section 4: Services We Offer
**Purpose**: Detailed but scannable service descriptions

**Card 2 — Furnace Repair & Replacement**
"Whether it's a minor fix or time for a new furnace, we'll give you honest recommendations — not a hard sell."

**Card 3 — Spring AC Tune-Up**

### Section 5: Why Sterling Heights Homeowners Call Us
**Purpose**: Differentiation and objection handling through benefits

**Layout**: Three-column feature blocks with icons, or alternating image/text rows

**Content Elements**:

**Block 1 — Upfront, Honest Pricing**
"We give you clear options — good, better, best — with pricing you see before we start. No surprise fees, no pressure."

**Block 2 — Local Crew, Familiar Faces**
"We're not a franchise or a 1-800 number. When you call, you talk to real people. When we visit, you'll see the same trusted technicians."

**Block 3 — We Fix What Needs Fixing**
"Not every problem needs a new system. We'll tell you honestly whether a repair makes sense or it's time to replace — and explain why."

**Block 4 — On-Time, Every Time**
"Your time matters. We show up when we say we will and keep you informed if anything changes."

**Rationale**: Each block directly counters the stated objections (price sensitivity, reliability, replace vs. repair). The language is conversational and aligned with the "straightforward, friendly, local, honest" brand voice.

### Section 6: How It Works (3-Step Process)
**Purpose**: Reduce friction by showing simplicity

**Step 2 — We Inspect & Explain**
"Our technician assesses the situation, explains what's going on in plain English, and gives you options."

"Choose what works for you — no pressure. We complete the work and make sure you're comfortable."

**Rationale**: Three-step processes reduce perceived complexity and commitment anxiety. Each step reinforces brand values (flexibility, transparency, no pressure).

- **Headline**: "Your Family's Safety Is Part of Every Visit"
- **Body copy**: "Every furnace inspection includes a carbon monoxide check. It's not about scaring you — it's about making sure your home is as safe as it is comfortable. Peace of mind comes standard."

**Rationale**: This addresses the CO safety angle authentically without manipulative fear tactics. Positions safety as a natural part of their thoroughness, not a sales pitch.
