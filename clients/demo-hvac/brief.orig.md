## Layout Strategy

### 1. Header
**Purpose**: Immediate access to contact and establish local identity

- Logo left-aligned
- "Sterling Heights, MI" location identifier near logo
- Phone number prominently displayed (large, clickable)
- Simple "Request Service" button as secondary option
- **Mobile**: Sticky bottom bar with phone icon and "Call Now" button throughout scroll

**Rationale**: Local service businesses live and die by phone accessibility. Every scroll position should be one tap from a call.

---

### 2. Hero Section
**Purpose**: Stop the scroll, acknowledge the problem, promise the solution

**Layout**:
- Bold headline addressing the core pain point
- Supporting subhead with trust elements woven in
- Primary CTA button (phone call)
- Secondary text link (online scheduling)
- Background: Subtle imagery suggesting home comfort (warm lighting, family home exterior) — avoid generic stock photos

**Suggested Headline Options**:
- "Stop Sweating and Freezing in Your Own Home"
- "Your Neighbors Trust Us to Keep Their Homes Comfortable"
- "When Your Furnace Quits, We Answer"

**Rationale**: The hero must immediately validate the visitor's problem and position Comfort Breeze as the local solution. The "own home" language reinforces this is about their personal space and family comfort.

---

### 3. Trust Bar
**Purpose**: Instant credibility without requiring scroll commitment

**Elements** (horizontal strip, icon-driven):
- "Licensed & Insured"
- "Family-Owned"
- "Serving Sterling Heights Since [Year]"
- "No Surprise Fees"

**Rationale**: These four trust signals address the core anxieties of hiring someone into your home: legitimacy, accountability, local knowledge, and pricing honesty.

---

### 4. Services Overview
**Purpose**: Clarify what they offer and enable self-qualification

**Layout**: Card-based grid (2x3 on desktop, stacked on mobile)

**Service Cards**:
1. **AC Installation & Replacement** — "Upgrade to reliable cooling"
2. **Furnace Replacement & Repair** — "Heat you can count on"
3. **Spring AC Tune-Up** — "Get ready before the heat hits"
4. **Fall Furnace Check** — "Safe, efficient heat all winter"
5. **Emergency No-Heat Service** — "Same-day response when you need it"
6. **Indoor Air Quality** — "Breathe easier at home"

Each card: Icon + Service Name + One-line description + "Learn more" or direct CTA

**Rationale**: Homeowners often search with a specific problem. This section lets them quickly identify their need and builds confidence that Comfort Breeze handles their exact situation.

---

### 5. Why Choose Us
**Purpose**: Differentiate from big-box competitors and address objections

**Headline**: "Why Homeowners Around Sterling Heights Call Us"

**Layout**: Three columns with icons, or alternating image/text blocks

**Key Points**:

1. **Honest, Upfront Pricing**
   "We give you options—good, better, best—and explain each one. No surprise fees, no pressure."

2. **Real People, Real Answers**
   "Call during business hours and talk to an actual human. See the same trusted faces on every visit."

3. **We Fix, Not Just Replace**
   "If your system can be repaired affordably, we'll tell you. We only recommend replacement when it makes sense."

**Rationale**: These three points directly counter the intake objections: price sensitivity/upsells, reliability/ghosting, and the replace-vs-repair dilemma. Each reassurance is specific and believable.

---

### 6. How It Works (3-Step Process)
**Purpose**: Reduce friction by showing simplicity

**Headline**: "Getting Comfortable Is Easy"

**Layout**: Horizontal numbered steps with icons

1. **Call or Schedule Online**
   "Reach us by phone or request service through our simple form."

2. **We Inspect & Explain**
   "Our technician arrives on time, diagnoses the issue, and walks you through what we find."

3. **You Choose Your Option**
   "We present clear choices with upfront pricing. You decide what's right for your home and budget."

**Rationale**: A 3-step process demystifies the experience and sets expectations. It subtly reinforces the no-pressure, transparent approach.

---

### 7. Safety & Peace of Mind
**Purpose**: Address the safety angle (CO leaks) without fear-mongering

**Layout**: Single centered block with subtle icon (shield or home with checkmark)

**Headline**: "Your Family's Safety Matters"

**Copy** (brief, reassuring):
"Every furnace check includes a carbon monoxide inspection. It's a simple step that gives you peace of mind—because keeping your family safe is just as important as keeping them warm."

**Rationale**: This addresses a genuine concern (CO poisoning) in a responsible way. It positions safety as a standard practice, not a scare tactic, which aligns with the honest brand voice.

---

### 8. Service Area
**Purpose**: Confirm local coverage and build geographic trust

**Headline**: "Proudly Serving Your Neighborhood"

**Layout**: Simple text list or subtle map graphic

**Areas Listed**:
- Sterling Heights
- Warren
- Troy
- Shelby Township
- Clinton Township
- "And surrounding communities within 30-40 minutes"

**Note**: Avoid downtown Detroit per client instructions

**Rationale**: Local searchers want confirmation you serve their area. The neighborhood language reinforces community connection.

---

### 9. About / Meet the Team
**Purpose**: Humanize the business and build trust for in-home service

**Headline**: "A Local Team You Can Trust in Your Home"

**Layout**: Short paragraph + placeholder for team photo

**Copy Direction**:
- Family-owned business
- How long serving the Sterling Heights area
- Commitment to treating customers like neighbors
- Brief mention of why they do this work (passion for helping homeowners)

**Photo Note**: When available, use real photos of the owner/technicians. Avoid stock photos of generic workers.

**Rationale**: For in-home services, people hire people they feel they can trust. A genuine about section with real faces dramatically increases conversion.

---

### 10. Final CTA Section
**Purpose**: Strong conversion push before footer

**Layout**: Full-width colored background (orange accent or blue), centered content

**Headline**: "Ready for Reliable Comfort?"

**Subhead**: "Call now to schedule your tune-up or get help with a no-heat emergency."

**Primary CTA**: "Call [Phone Number]" (large button)
**Secondary CTA**: "Or Request Service Online" (text link)

**Optional addition**: "Financing available for larger replacements" (small text note below CTAs)

**Rationale**: Visitors who scroll this far need one final, clear prompt. The dual CTA respects different preferences (call vs. form).

### 11. Footer
**Purpose**: Utility navigation and final trust reinfor
