## Layout Strategy

### Section 1: Hero
**Purpose**: Stop the scroll, speak directly to the homeowner's frustration, and drive immediate calls.

**Layout**: Full-width background (subtle gradient or lifestyle image of comfortable home), centered headline, subhead, and dual CTAs.

**Content Direction**:
- **Headline**: "Stop Sweating and Freezing in Your Own House"
- **Subhead**: "Sterling Heights' trusted HVAC team—honest pricing, on-time service, no surprise fees."
- **Primary CTA**: "Call Now to Schedule" (prominent phone number, click-to-call)
- **Secondary CTA**: "Request a Quote Online" (button linking to form)

**Design Notes**: Phone number should be large and tappable. Hero image (when available) should show real technician or local home—avoid generic stock. Blues dominate with orange CTA buttons.

---

### Section 2: Trust Bar
**Purpose**: Immediately establish credibility before visitors scroll further.

**Layout**: Horizontal strip with 4-5 trust indicators, subtle background differentiation.

**Content Direction**:
- "Family-Owned & Operated"
- "Licensed & Insured"
- "Serving Sterling Heights Since [Year]"
- "Same-Day Emergency Service"
- "Upfront Pricing—No Surprises"

**Design Notes**: Simple icons paired with short text. Keep it scannable. No fake star ratings or unverified claims.

---

### Section 3: Services Overview
**Purpose**: Quickly communicate full service range so visitors know they're in the right place.

**Layout**: Grid of service cards (2x3 on desktop, stacked on mobile), each with icon, service name, and one-line description.

**Services to Include**:
1. **AC Installation & Replacement** — "Upgrade to reliable cooling that lasts"
2. **Furnace Repair & Replacement** — "Heat you can count on all winter"
3. **Spring AC Tune-Ups** — "Get ahead of the heat—schedule early"
4. **Fall Furnace Check** — "Safe, efficient heating before the cold hits"
5. **Emergency No-Heat Service** — "Fast response when you need it most"
6. **Indoor Air Quality Solutions** — "Cleaner air for your family's health"

**Design Notes**: Use consistent iconography in brand blue. Cards should have subtle shadows for depth. Each card could link to a future detailed service page (note for dev).

### Section 4: Why Choose Us
**Purpose**: Differentiate from big-box competitors and address core objections head-on.

**Layout**: Two-column layout—left side with heading and intro paragraph, right side with 3-4 benefit blocks (icon + headline + short paragraph).

**Content Direction**:

*Intro*: "Why Homeowners Around Sterling Heights Call Us"

**Benefit 1: Honest, Upfront Pricing**
"We give you clear options—good, better, best—with pricing before any work starts. No surprise fees, no pressure to upsell."

**Benefit 2: A Small Crew You Can Trust**
"You'll see the same familiar faces, not a rotating cast of strangers. We're your neighbors, and we treat your home like our own."

**Benefit 3: We Show Up When We Say We Will**
"Real humans answer the phone during business hours. We confirm appointments and arrive on time—because your time matters."

**Benefit 4: Repair-First Mindset**
"We'll never push a replacement you don't need. We explain your options honestly so you can make the right call for your home and budget."

**Design Notes**: Use checkmarks or custom icons. This section should feel warm and personal—consider a small team photo if available.

### Section 5: How It Works (3-Step Process)
**Purpose**: Remove friction by showing how simple it is to get service.

**Layout**: Horizontal 3-step flow with numbered circles, icons, and short descriptions. Stacks vertically on mobile.

**Content Direction**:

**Step 1: Call or Book Online**
"Give us a call or fill out our quick online form. We'll find a time that works for your schedule."

**Step 2: We Inspect & Explain**
"Our technician arrives on time, diagnoses the issue, and walks you through your options—no jargon, no pressure."

**Step 3: You Choose, We Fix**
"Pick the option that fits your needs. We get to work and make sure you're comfortable before we leave."

**Design Notes**: Use connecting lines or arrows between steps. Numbers should be prominent (orange accent). Keep text minimal.

---

### Section 6: Safety & Peace of Mind
**Purpose**: Address the serious (but not fear-mongering) safety aspect of furnace maintenance.

**Layout**: Single-column centered text block with subtle icon or illustration. Alternatively, a horizontal callout box.

**Content Direction**:

*Headline*: "Your Family's Safety Is Part of Every Visit"

*Body*: "Every furnace tune-up includes a carbon monoxide safety check. It's a simple step that gives you peace of mind heading into winter—and it's included at no extra charge."

**Design Notes**: Keep tone calm and reassuring, not alarmist. A simple home/shield icon works well. Consider a light blue or neutral background to set this apart.

---

### Section 7: Service Area
**Purpose**: Confirm geographic fit and reinforce local positioning.

**Layout**: Left side with heading and list of communities served; right side with simple service area map (or placeholder for one).

**Content Direction**:

*Headline*: "Proudly Serving Sterling Heights & Nearby Communities"

*Communities List*:
- Sterling Heights
- Warren
- Troy
- Shelby Township
- Clinton Township
- And surrounding areas within 30-40 minutes

*Note*: "Not sure if you're in our service area? Give us a call—we're happy to check."

**Design Notes**: Map should be clean and simple (avoid cluttered Google Maps embed). List format works if map isn't available initially.

---

### Section 8: About Us / Meet the Team
**Purpose**: Build personal connection and reinforce the "small local crew" message.

**Layout**: Two-column—left side with team photo (or placeholder), right side with story copy.

**Content Direction**:

*Headline*: "Meet Your Local HVAC Team"

*Body*: "Comfort Breeze is a family-owned business right here in Sterling Heights. We started because we saw too many homeowners getting burned by pushy salespeople and surprise bills. Our approach is different: show up on time, explain things in plain English, and do honest work at fair prices. When you call us, you're not getting a call center—you're getting neighbors who care about keeping your home comfortable."

**Design Notes**: Authentic photo of owner/team is ideal. If not available, use a placeholder with note for future update. Avoid stock photos of fake technicians.

### Section 9: Contact / Final CTA
**Purpose**: Strong closing push for phone calls and secondary option for online requests.

**Layout**: Centered section with prominent phone number, supporting text,
