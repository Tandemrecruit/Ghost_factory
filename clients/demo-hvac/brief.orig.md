## Layout Strategy

### Section 1: Hero
**Purpose:** Immediately connect with the visitor's discomfort and position Comfort Breeze as the local solution.

**Content:**
- **Headline:** "Stop Sweating and Freezing in Your Own Home"
- **Subheadline:** "Sterling Heights' trusted HVAC team — honest pricing, on-time service, real comfort."
- **Primary CTA Button:** "Call Now to Schedule Service" (click-to-call, orange accent)
- **Secondary CTA:** "Request a Quote Online" (outlined button, links to form)
- **Supporting element:** Phone number displayed prominently (large, clickable)
- **Visual:** Authentic photo of technician with homeowner at door, or clean illustration of comfortable home interior — avoid generic stock imagery

**Rationale:** The headline speaks directly to the pain point. Subheadline reinforces local trust and transparency. Dual CTAs accommodate both phone-preference and form-preference visitors.

---

### Section 2: Trust Bar
**Purpose:** Establish immediate credibility before visitors scroll further.

**Content (horizontal strip with icons):**
- "Family-Owned & Operated"
- "Licensed & Insured"
- "Serving Sterling Heights Since [Year]"
- "Same-Day Emergency Service"

**Rationale:** Local service businesses must overcome "stranger in my home" hesitation. These trust markers are concise, scannable, and address core anxieties upfront.

---

### Section 3: Services Overview
**Purpose:** Clearly communicate the full scope of services so visitors immediately understand Comfort Breeze can solve their problem.

**Content:**
- **Section Headline:** "Heating, Cooling & Air Quality Services for Your Home"
- **Service Cards (icon + brief description for each):**
  - **AC Installation & Changeouts** — "Upgrade to efficient cooling that actually keeps up."
  - **Furnace Replacement & Repair** — "Stay warm with a system that runs safely and reliably."
  - **Spring AC Tune-Ups** — "Get ahead of the heat with a quick system check."
  - **Fall Furnace Inspections** — "Prep your furnace before the first freeze."
  - **Emergency No-Heat Service** — "Furnace out? We offer same-day response."
  - **Indoor Air Quality Options** — "Breathe easier with cleaner air solutions."

**Rationale:** A clean service menu helps visitors self-identify their need. Brief descriptions avoid overwhelming while confirming expertise across HVAC needs.

---

### Section 4: Why Choose Us
**Purpose:** Differentiate from big-box competitors and address key objections.

**Content:**
- **Section Headline:** "Why Homeowners Around Sterling Heights Call Us"
- **Three pillars with icons:**
  
  **1. Honest, Upfront Pricing**
  "No surprise fees. We explain your options — good, better, and best — so you choose what's right for your budget."
  
  **2. Same Crew, Every Time**
  "We're a small local team. You'll see the same familiar faces, not a rotating cast of strangers."
  
  **3. We Fix, Not Push**
  "Need a repair? We'll repair it. We only recommend replacement when it truly makes sense — and we'll show you why."

**Rationale:** Each pillar directly counters the objections identified (upsell concerns, reliability/ghosting, replace vs. repair pressure). Specific language builds trust.

---

### Section 5: How It Works (3-Step Process)
**Purpose:** Reduce friction by showing how simple it is to get help.

**Content:**
- **Section Headline:** "Getting Comfortable Is Easy"
- **Step 1:** "Call or Request Online" — "Reach a real person during business hours. No phone trees, no runaround."
- **Step 2:** "We Inspect & Explain" — "Our technician arrives on time, diagnoses the issue, and walks you through what we find."
- **Step 3:** "You Pick Your Option" — "Choose the solution that fits your needs and budget. We get to work."

**Visual:** Simple numbered icons or illustrated steps; clean and uncluttered

**Rationale:** A 3-step process demystifies the service call experience and emphasizes customer control — key for visitors hesitant about being pressured.

---

### Section 6: Safety Message
**Purpose:** Introduce the safety/CO angle without fear-mongering; position tune-ups as protective, not just performance-based.

**Content:**
- **Headline:** "Your Family's Safety Matters to Us"
- **Body copy:** "Every furnace inspection includes a carbon monoxide safety check. It's a quick step that gives you peace of mind — and it's part of every visit, not an upsell."
- **Optional icon:** Small CO detector or shield icon

**Rationale:** Homeowners with families respond to safety messaging. Framing the CO check as "included" (not extra) reinforces the no-surprise-fees promise.

---

### Section 7: Service Area
**Purpose:** Confirm geographic coverage and reinforce local identity.

**Content:**
- **Section Headline:** "Proudly Serving Our Neighbors"
- **List or simple visual map showing:**
  - Sterling Heights
  - Warren
  - Troy
  - Shelby Township
  - Clinton Township
  - "And surrounding communities within 30–40 minutes"
- **Note:** "We're based right here in Sterling Heights — not a call center hours away."

**Rationale:** Local businesses win on proximity and familiarity. Explicitly naming communities improves local SEO and builds geographic trust.

---

### Section 8: About Us / Meet the Team
**Purpose:** Humanize the business; address "stranger in my home" concerns.

**Content:**
- **Section Headline:** "Meet Your Local HVAC Team"
- **Short paragraph:** "Comfort Breeze is family-owned and operated right here in Sterling Heights. We're not a franchise or a big corporate outfit — just a small crew of HVAC pros who take pride in doing honest work for our neighbors."
- **Placeholder for team photo(s):** Real photo of owner/technicians preferred (can be added later)
- **Optional:** Brief owner quote about why they started the business

**Rationale:** Personal connection reduces anxiety about inviting service providers into the home. Even placeholder language sets the tone for authenticity.

---

### Section 9: Final CTA Section
**Purpose:** Strong conversion push before footer; capture visitors ready to act.

**Content:**
- **Headline:** "Ready to Get Comfortable?"
- **Subheadline:** "Call now for same-day service or schedule your tune-up online."
- **Primary CTA:** "Call Now to Schedule Service" (large, orange button, click-to-call)
- **Secondary CTA:** "Request a Quote" (outlined button)
- **Phone number:** Displayed prominently again
- **Optional line:** "Financing available for larger replacements — ask us for details."

**Rationale:** Repeating the CTA at page bottom captures visitors who scrolled to learn more. Financing
