# Project Brief: Comfort Breeze Heating & Air

## Overview
Comfort Breeze Heating & Air is a family-owned residential HVAC company serving Sterling Heights, MI and surrounding communities within a 30-40 minute radius. The landing page targets homeowners aged 30-65 who value comfort, safety, and working with trustworthy local experts over DIY solutions. The primary goal is generating phone calls and online scheduling requests for seasonal tune-ups and emergency no-heat service, with messaging that emphasizes honest pricing, reliable service, and genuine local expertise.

## Brand Colors
- **Primary Blue**: Deep, trustworthy blue (suggests reliability and cooling) — use for headers, buttons, and key trust elements
- **Secondary Blue**: Lighter blue for backgrounds and supporting sections
- **Accent Orange**: Warm orange for heat-related messaging, CTAs, and visual warmth — use sparingly to draw attention to calls-to-action
- **Neutral White/Light Gray**: Clean backgrounds to maintain readability
- **Text**: Dark charcoal or navy for body copy

## Layout Strategy

### Section 1: Hero
**Purpose**: Immediately connect with the homeowner's frustration and position Comfort Breeze as the local solution.

**Layout**: Full-width hero with background image (real local home or technician at work — avoid stock). Text overlay on left or centered.

**Content Elements**:
- **Headline**: "Stop Sweating and Freezing in Your Own Home"
- **Subheadline**: "Sterling Heights' trusted HVAC team — honest pricing, on-time service, no surprises."
- **Primary CTA Button**: "Call Now to Schedule Service" (click-to-call, orange button)
- **Secondary CTA**: "Request a Quote Online" (text link or ghost button below)
- **Trust micro-bar below CTA**: "Licensed & Insured • Family-Owned • Serving Macomb County"

**Rationale**: The headline speaks directly to the pain point without being generic ("HVAC services you can trust"). The subheadline immediately establishes local credibility and addresses the top objection (surprise fees). Dual CTAs accommodate both phone-first and form-preference users.

### Section 2: Service Overview Bar
**Purpose**: Quick scannable snapshot of what they do — helps visitors self-qualify immediately.

**Layout**: Horizontal icon bar with 5-6 service categories, each with small icon and short label.

**Content Elements**:
- AC Installation & Replacement
- Furnace Repair & Replacement  
- Spring AC Tune-Ups
- Fall Furnace Checkups
- Emergency No-Heat Service
- Indoor Air Quality Solutions

**Rationale**: Homeowners visiting during an emergency or seasonal need should see their specific issue represented within 2 seconds of scrolling. Icons create visual hierarchy without overwhelming.

---

### Section 3: Why Choose Us (Local Trust Section)
**Purpose**: Address the core objections (upselling, ghosting, honesty) through differentiators.

**Layout**: 2 or 3-column grid with icon/illustration + heading + 2-3 sentence description each.

**Content Elements**:

**Column 1 — Upfront, Honest Pricing**
"No surprise fees, ever. We'll walk you through your options — good, better, and best — so you choose what works for your budget. We quote before we start."

**Column 2 — Local Crew, Familiar Faces**
"We're not a dispatch center three states away. When you call during business hours, you talk to a real person. When we show up, you'll see the same trusted technicians."

**Column 3 — We Fix It Right (Not Just Replace It)**
"Not everything needs replacing. We'll give you an honest assessment and only recommend new equipment when it truly makes sense. Your trust matters more than a quick sale."

**Rationale**: These three points directly counter the stated objections. The language is conversational and aligns with the "straightforward, friendly, honest" brand voice. This section builds the trust foundation before diving into services.

---

### Section 4: Service List with Details
**Purpose**: Provide enough detail for informed decision-making without overwhelming.

**Layout**: Alternating content blocks (image left/text right, then flip) OR stacked cards with expandable details.

**Content Elements**:

**AC Installation & Changeouts**
"Upgrading to a new system? We'll help you find the right size and efficiency for your home — and your budget. Financing available for larger projects."

**Furnace Replacement & Repair**
"Whether it's a minor repair or time for a new furnace, we'll explain your options clearly. No pressure, just honest guidance."

**Spring AC Tune-Up**
"Beat the summer rush. A quick tune-up keeps your system running efficiently and catches small issues before they become expensive problems."

**Fall Furnace Checkup**
"Get your furnace ready for Michigan winters. Our checkup includes a carbon monoxide safety inspection for your family's peace of mind."

**Emergency No-Heat Service**
"Woke up to a cold house? We offer same-day emergency service to get your heat back on fast. Call us — we answer."

**Indoor Air Quality**
"From air purifiers to humidity control, we can help make your home's air cleaner and healthier for your family."

**Rationale**: Each service block addresses a specific need while weaving in trust language (honest guidance, peace of mind, we answer). The seasonal services are positioned with urgency cues.

---

### Section 5: How It Works (3-Step Process)
**Purpose**: Reduce friction by showing how simple it is to get service.

**Layout**: Horizontal 3-column with numbered circles or step icons.

**Content Elements**:

**Step 1: Call or Schedule Online**
"Give us a call during business hours or fill out our quick online form. We'll get back to you promptly — usually the same day."

**Step 2: We Inspect & Diagnose**
"Our technician arrives on time, inspects your system, and explains exactly what's going on — no jargon, no confusion."

**Step 3: You Choose Your Option**
"We present clear options with upfront pricing. You decide what's right for you. No pressure, no hidden fees."

**Rationale**: The 3-step framework reduces perceived complexity and reinforces the "no surprises" messaging. Each step subtly addresses an objection (responsiveness, clarity, no pressure).

---

### Section 6: Safety & Peace of Mind
**Purpose**: Address the safety angle (CO leaks) without fear-mongering.

**Layout**: Single centered block with subtle background color (light blue) and small icon.

**Content Elements**:
**Heading**: "Your Family's Safety, Our Priority"
**Body**: "Every furnace tune-up includes a carbon monoxide check. It's a simple step that gives you peace of mind heading into winter. We take care of the details so you don't have to worry."

**Rationale**: Safety is a genuine differentiator but must be handled carefully. This language is reassuring rather than alarming, positioning the CO check as a standard care practice rather than a scare tactic.

---

### Section 7: Service Area
**Purpose**: Confirm coverage and establish local roots.

**Layout**: Simple map graphic (stylized, not Google embed) OR text list with clean formatting.

**Content Elements**:
**Heading**: "Proudly Serving Sterling Heights & Neighboring Communities"
**Areas Listed**: Sterling Heights, Warren, Troy, Shelby Township, Clinton Township, and surrounding areas within 30-40 minutes.
**Note**: "Not sure if we cover your area? Give us a call — if we can help, we will."

**Rationale**: The conversational note at the end softens the boundary and encourages calls even from edge-case locations. Avoids downtown Detroit per client guidance without explicitly stating exclusion.

### Section 8: About / Meet the Team
**Purpose**: Humanize the business and reinforce "family-owned, local" positioning.

**Layout**: Image (team photo or owner portrait) with adjacent text block.

**Content Elements**:
**Heading**: "A Small Local Team You Can Trust"
**Body**: "Comfort Bre
