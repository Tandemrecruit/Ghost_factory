# Project Brief: Comfort Breeze Heating & Air

## Overview

Comfort Breeze Heating & Air is a family-owned HVAC company serving homeowners in Sterling Heights, MI and surrounding communities within a 30-40 minute radius. The landing page targets homeowners aged 30-65 who value comfort, safety, and working with a trustworthy local expert rather than a faceless corporate service. The primary goal is generating inbound phone calls and online scheduling for seasonal tune-ups and emergency no-heat service, with messaging that emphasizes honest pricing, reliable scheduling, and the personal touch of a small local crew.

- **Accent Orange**: A warm orange (#E8762D) representing heat/warmth for CTAs and highlights—creates urgency and warmth

## Layout Strategy

### 1. Header
**Purpose**: Immediate access to phone contact; establish local identity

**Elements**:
- Logo (left-aligned)
- Phone number with phone icon (right-aligned, visible on desktop)
- "Sterling Heights, MI" location indicator
- Mobile: Hamburger menu with sticky click-to-call bar at bottom

**Rationale**: For local service businesses, 60%+ of conversions come via phone. The number must be visible within 1 second of landing.

### 2. Hero Section
**Purpose**: Stop the scroll with relatable problem-solution messaging; immediate CTA

**Layout**: Split layout—headline/copy on left (60%), supporting image on right (40%)

**Content**:
- **Pre-headline**: "Serving Sterling Heights & Surrounding Communities"
- **Headline**: "Stop Sweating and Freezing in Your Own House"
- **Subheadline**: "We're a small, local HVAC crew that shows up on time, explains your options clearly, and fixes comfort problems—without surprise fees."
- **Primary CTA Button**: "Call Now to Schedule Service" (orange, prominent)
- **Secondary CTA**: "Request a Quote Online" (text link or ghost button)
- **Supporting Detail**: "Same-day service available for no-heat emergencies"

**Image Direction**: Real photo of technician (or truck with branding) in front of a residential home—avoid stock. If unavailable, use a warm, inviting home interior suggesting comfort.

**Rationale**: The headline addresses the emotional frustration (temperature discomfort at home), while the subheadline immediately counters the top objections: timing, transparency, and hidden costs.

---

### 3. Trust Bar
**Purpose**: Quick credibility scan for skeptical visitors

**Layout**: Horizontal strip with 4-5 trust indicators, icons + short text

**Content**:
- "Licensed & Insured"
- "Family-Owned & Operated"
- "Locally Based in Sterling Heights"
- "Upfront Pricing—No Surprise Fees"
- Optional: "Serving [X] Years" (if applicable)

**Rationale**: Local service customers need to trust someone entering their home. These badges answer "Can I trust you?" in under 3 seconds.

---

### 4. Services Overview
**Purpose**: Clarify scope of work; help visitors self-identify their need

**Layout**: Grid of 6 service cards (2x3 on desktop, stacked on mobile)

**Content Cards**:
1. **AC Installation & Replacement** — "Upgrade to reliable cooling that lasts"
2. **Furnace Replacement & Repair** — "Stay warm all winter with dependable heat"
3. **Spring AC Tune-Up** — "Get ahead of the heat with a quick check"
4. **Fall Furnace Check** — "Prepare for winter and catch problems early"
5. **Emergency No-Heat Service** — "Fast response when you need heat now"
6. **Indoor Air Quality Options** — "Breathe easier with cleaner air at home"

Each card: Icon + Service Name + One-line description + "Learn More" or direct phone link for urgent services

**Rationale**: Homeowners often search for specific services. Clear categorization helps them confirm they're in the right place and reduces bounce.

---

### 5. Why Choose Us
**Purpose**: Differentiate from big-box competitors and address objections

**Layout**: Left column with headline/intro, right column with 3-4 benefit blocks (icon + headline + 2-sentence explanation)

**Headline**: "Why Homeowners Around Sterling Heights Call Us"

**Benefit Blocks**:
1. **"Honest Options, Upfront Pricing"**
   "We give you clear choices—good, better, best—and explain each one. You'll know exactly what you're paying before we start any work."

2. **"A Small Crew You Can Trust"**
   "No random subcontractors. You'll see the same familiar faces who know your home and actually care about getting it right."

3. **"We Show Up When We Say We Will"**
   "Real humans answer the phone during business hours. We respect your time with arrival windows we actually keep."

4. **"Repair-First Mindset"**
   "We'll never push a replacement you don't need. If a repair makes sense, we'll tell you—and explain when it's time to consider replacing."

**Rationale**: Each benefit directly counters a stated objection (upselling, reliability, ghosting, replace vs. repair). This builds trust through specificity.

---

### 6. How It Works (3-Step Process)
**Purpose**: Reduce friction by showing simplicity; set expectations

**Layout**: Horizontal 3-step flow with numbered circles, icons, and short copy

**Steps**:
1. **Call or Book Online**
   "Give us a call or fill out our quick form. A real person will get back to you—fast."

2. **We Inspect & Explain**
   "Our technician arrives on time, diagnoses the issue, and walks you through what's happening with your system."

3. **You Get Clear Options**
   "We'll give you straightforward choices with upfront pricing. You decide what's right for your home and budget."

**CTA Below**: "Ready to get started? Call now or request a quote."

**Rationale**: The 3-step format creates a cognitive shortcut: "This is easy." It also previews the experience, reducing anxiety about the unknown.

---

### 7. Safety Message
**Purpose**: Add urgency and value without fear-mongering; highlight expertise

**Layout**: Centered text block with subtle background color (light blue) and small icon (shield or checkmark)

**Content**:
- **Headline**: "Your Family's Safety Is Part of Every Visit"
- **Body**: "Every furnace check includes a carbon monoxide inspection. It's not an upsell—it's just the right thing to do. We want your home comfortable *and* safe."

**Rationale**: CO safety is a genuine concern and differentiator. The tone here is matter-of-fact and caring, not alarmist—matching their brand voice of "straightforward" and "honest."

---

### 8. Service Area
**Purpose**: Confirm geographic relevance; local SEO value

**Layout**: Left side with text list of communities, right side with simple map graphic (or embedded map if performance allows)

**Headline**: "Proudly Serving These Communities"

**Communities List**:
- Sterling Heights
- Warren
- Troy
- Shelby Township
- Clinton Township
- "And surrounding areas within 30-40 minutes"

**Note**: "We're based right here in Sterling Heights—not a call center halfway across the country."

**Rationale**: Local service searches are highly geo-specific. Listing communities builds trust ("they know my area") and supports local SEO.

### 9. About / Family-Owned
**Purpose**: Humanize the
