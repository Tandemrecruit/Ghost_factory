## Layout Strategy

### 1. Hero Section
**Purpose**: Stop the scroll, validate they're in the right place, drive immediate action

**Layout**: Full-width with subtle gradient overlay on lifestyle image
- **Headline** (H1): "Stop Sweating—and Freezing—in Your Own Home"
- **Subheadline**: "Sterling Heights families trust Comfort Breeze for honest HVAC service with upfront pricing and no surprises."
- **Primary CTA**: Large orange button — "Call Now: [Phone Number]" with phone icon
- **Secondary CTA**: Ghost button — "Request a Quote Online"
- **Trust Micro-copy**: Below CTAs: "✓ Same-Day Emergency Service Available | ✓ Licensed & Insured | ✓ Family-Owned Since [Year]"

**Rationale**: The hero headline directly addresses the core pain point (temperature discomfort at home) while the subheadline immediately establishes local credibility and the "no surprises" promise that overcomes the #1 objection.

---

### 2. Trust Bar
**Purpose**: Instant credibility without requiring scrolling

**Layout**: Horizontal strip with 4-5 trust indicators
- Licensed & Insured badge
- "Locally Owned & Operated" with Michigan icon
- Years in business
- "Real Humans Answer the Phone" (differentiator)
- Service area radius indicator

**Rationale**: Local service businesses must overcome "stranger in my home" hesitation immediately. These signals answer "Can I trust these people?" before the visitor consciously asks it.

---

### 3. Services Overview
**Purpose**: Quick clarity on what they offer and prompt self-qualification

**Layout**: Icon-based grid (2x3 on desktop, stacked on mobile)

**Services to highlight:**
1. **AC Installation & Replacement** — "Cool comfort for Michigan summers"
2. **Furnace Repair & Replacement** — "Heat you can count on all winter"
3. **Spring AC Tune-Ups** — "Get ahead of the heat wave"
4. **Fall Furnace Checkups** — "Safe, efficient heating before the cold hits"
5. **Emergency No-Heat Service** — "Same-day response when you need it most"
6. **Indoor Air Quality** — "Breathe easier at home"

**CTA beneath grid**: "Not sure what you need? Call us — we'll help you figure it out." [Phone number]

**Rationale**: Presenting services as a clear menu helps visitors self-select while the friendly CTA reinforces the "no pressure, we'll help" brand voice.

---

### 4. Why Choose Comfort Breeze
**Purpose**: Differentiate from big-box competitors and address objections

**Layout**: Two-column with alternating icon/text blocks

**Key differentiators:**
1. **"Upfront Pricing, No Surprise Fees"**
   "We'll explain your options—good, better, and best—before any work begins. The price we quote is the price you pay."

2. **"Same Faces, Every Visit"**
   "We're a small local crew, not a rotating cast of strangers. You'll see familiar faces who know your home and your system."

3. **"We Show Up When We Say We Will"**
   "Your time matters. We call ahead, arrive on schedule, and respect your home like it's our own."

4. **"Honest Recommendations"**
   "We'll only suggest replacement when repair isn't the smart choice. You get options and straight talk—never a hard sell."

**Rationale**: Each point directly counters the three stated objections (price/upselling, reliability/ghosting, replace vs. repair). This builds trust through specificity.

---

### 5. How It Works (3-Step Process)
**Purpose**: Reduce friction by showing simplicity

**Layout**: Horizontal 3-column with numbered steps, icons, and brief descriptions

**Step 1: Call or Request Online**
"Reach a real person during business hours. Tell us what's going on—we'll ask a few quick questions to understand the issue."

**Step 2: We Come to You & Inspect**
"Our technician arrives on time, takes a thorough look at your system, and explains exactly what's happening in plain English."

**Step 3: You Choose Your Option**
"We present clear options with upfront pricing. You decide what's right for your home and budget—no pressure, no surprises."

**CTA**: "Ready to get comfortable? Call [Phone Number]" — Orange button

**Rationale**: A 3-step process demystifies the experience and reduces anxiety about "what happens after I call?" This is critical for first-time customers.

---

### 6. Safety & Peace of Mind
**Purpose**: Address safety concerns (especially CO) without fear-mongering

**Layout**: Single content block with subtle blue background, icon of home/shield

**Headline**: "Your Family's Safety Is Part of Every Visit"

**Copy**: "Every furnace inspection includes a carbon monoxide check—because keeping your family safe matters as much as keeping them warm. It's just part of how we do things."

**Tone note**: Matter-of-fact, reassuring, not alarmist

**Rationale**: Safety is a genuine selling point for furnace services, but over-dramatizing it feels manipulative. This positions the CO check as standard care, not a scare tactic.

---

### 7. Service Area
**Purpose**: Confirm geographic qualification and reinforce local identity

**Layout**: Map graphic (stylized, not Google embed) + list of communities

**Headline**: "Proudly Serving Sterling Heights & Surrounding Communities"

**Communities listed:**
- Sterling Heights
- Warren
- Troy
- Shelby Township
- Clinton Township
- (+ "and neighbors within 30-40 minutes")

**Copy**: "We're based right here in Sterling Heights. When you call Comfort Breeze, you're calling your neighbors."

**Rationale**: Local searchers need geographic confirmation quickly. The neighbor positioning reinforces community connection over corporate distance.

---

### 8. About / Meet the Team
**Purpose**: Humanize the business and build personal trust

**Layout**: Photo placeholder (team or owner) with story block

**Headline**: "Family-Owned, Locally Operated"

**Copy framework**: 
"Comfort Breeze was founded by [Owner Name] right here in [City]. After [X] years in the HVAC industry, [he/she] saw too many homeowners get burned by surprise bills and technicians who treated them like a number. We do things differently—honest work, fair prices, and neighbors helping neighbors stay comfortable year-round."

**Note**: Placeholder for actual owner story and team photo when available

**Rationale**: For in-home services, customers want to know who's entering their space. A real story with real faces dramatically increases conversion over anonymous corporate messaging.

---

### 9. Contact / Final CTA Section
**Purpose**: Convert remaining visitors who've scrolled through content

**Layout**: Split section — Phone CTA on left, contact form on right

**Left side:**
- **Headline**: "Ready to Get Comfortable?"
- Large phone number (click-to-call)
