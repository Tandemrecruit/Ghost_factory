## Why Choose Comfort Breeze

### Upfront Pricing, No Surprise Fees

We'll explain your options—good, better, and best—before any work begins. The price we quote is the price you pay. No hidden charges, no "oh, by the way" fees when the job's done.

### Same Faces, Every Visit

We're a small local crew, not a rotating cast of strangers. You'll see familiar faces who know your home and your system. We remember you called last spring about that noisy compressor, and we'll ask how it's been running.

### We Show Up When We Say We Will

Your time matters. We call ahead, arrive on schedule, and respect your home like it's our own. Shoe covers aren't optional—they're standard. Same with cleaning up after ourselves.

### Honest Recommendations

We'll only suggest replacement when repair isn't the smart choice. You get options and straight talk—never a hard sell. If your 8-year-old furnace needs a $200 part, we're not going to pressure you into a $6,000 replacement.

## How It Works

### Step 1: Call or Request Online

Reach a real person during business hours. Tell us what's going on—we'll ask a few quick questions to understand the issue. If it's an emergency, we'll get someone out the same day.

### Step 2: We Come to You & Inspect

Our technician arrives on time, takes a thorough look at your system, and explains exactly what's happening in plain English. No jargon, no runaround—just honest answers.

### Step 3: You Choose Your Option

We present clear options with upfront pricing. You decide what's right for your home and budget—no pressure, no surprises. We'll even walk you through the pros and cons of each choice.

## Safety & Peace of Mind

### Your Family's Safety Is Part of Every Visit

Every furnace inspection includes a carbon monoxide check—because keeping your family safe matters as much as keeping them warm. It's just part of how we do things.

We test for proper ventilation, look for gas leaks, and make sure your system is operating the way it should. You'll never pay extra for safety checks. They're built into every service call, because that's how it should be done.

## About / Meet the Team

### Family-Owned, Locally Operated

Comfort Breeze was founded by Mike Patterson right here in Sterling Heights. After 12 years working for one of the big national HVAC chains, Mike saw too many homeowners get burned by surprise bills and technicians who treated them like a number.

He started Comfort Breeze with a simple promise: do honest work, charge fair prices, and treat every home like it belongs to family. Fifteen years later, we're still keeping that promise—one furnace, one air conditioner, one neighbor at a time.

Our crew is small by design. We'd rather do excellent work for fewer families than rush through appointments to hit a quota. You'll get to know us, and we'll get to know your home's quirks (like that basement door that sticks, or where you keep the circuit breaker).

When you call Comfort Breeze, you're not getting a corporation. You're getting Mike, Dave, and Sarah—people who live in the same community, shop at the same stores, and understand what matters to Sterling Heights families.

## Testimonials

### What Your Neighbors Are Saying

**"Mike explained everything without talking down to me."**

"I was dreading calling an HVAC company because I didn't want to be sold something I didn't need. Mike came out, showed me exactly what was wrong with my furnace, and gave me three different options with honest advice about each one. No pressure, no sales pitch—just straight talk. We went with the mid-level repair and it's been running perfectly for two years."

— *Jennifer M., Sterling Heights*

---

**"They showed up exactly when they said they would."**

"I've dealt with so many contractors who give you a four-hour window and show up six hours late. Comfort Breeze called 30 minutes before arrival, showed up right on time, and had my AC back up and running in under an hour. It's such a relief to work with professionals who respect your schedule."

— *Robert K., Warren*

---

**"Same-day emergency service saved us."**

"Our furnace died on the coldest night of January. I called Comfort Breeze at 7 PM, expecting to leave a voicemail. A real person answered. Dave was at our house by 8:30 PM and had us back up and running before 10. The price was exactly what he quoted on the phone—no 'emergency surcharge' surprises. We've used them for everything since."

— *The Torres Family, Troy*

---

**"They told me I DIDN'T need a replacement."**

"Another company told me my 10-year-old AC unit was 'on its last legs' and I needed to replace it immediately for $7,500. I got a second opinion from Comfort Breeze. Mike said it just needed a $300 part and some refrigerant. That was three years ago and it's still running strong. I appreciate the honesty—not every company would talk you OUT of a big sale."

— *David L., Clinton Township*

---

**"I trust them completely."**

"I'm a single mom and I don't know anything about furnaces or AC units. I need someone I can trust to be honest with me and not take advantage. The Comfort Breeze team has been servicing my HVAC system for five years now. They explain things in normal language, they're always fair with pricing, and I never feel like I'm being upsold. That peace of mind is worth everything."

— *Amanda S., Shelby Township*

---

**"The small details matter."**

"Shoe covers without being asked. Tarps under their work area. Called 20 minutes before arrival. Cleaned up everything when they were done. These might seem like small things, but they show respect. Comfort Breeze treats your home the way you'd want it treated. That's rare these days."

— *Michael and Karen P., Sterling Heights*

- Refrigerant level check and adjustment if needed
- Condenser coil cleaning
- Evaporator coil inspection
- Condensate drain cleaning
- Electrical connection inspection
- Thermostat calibration check

### Frequently Asked Questions

**How quickly can you get here for an emergency?**

For true emergencies (no heat in winter, no AC during a heat wave), we offer same-day service and typically arrive within 2-4 hours of your call. We'll give you an estimated arrival time when you call.

**Do you offer financing?**

Yes. For larger projects like system replacements, we offer financing options through [financing partner]. We'll walk you through the options when we provide your estimate.

**What brands do you work on?**

We service all major HVAC brands including Carrier, Trane, Lennox, Rheem, Goodman, American Standard, and more. If you have a less common brand, give us a call—we can usually help.

**How do I know if I need repair or replacement?**

Great question. We'll always give you both options with honest advice. Generally, if your system is less than 10-12 years old and the repair costs less than half of replacement, repair makes sense. If it's older and needs expensive repairs, replacement might be the smarter long-term choice. We'll explain the math and let you decide.

**Do you provide written estimates?**

Yes, always. You'll get a written estimate before any work begins, and we'll explain exactly what we're doing and why.

**What payment methods do you accept?**

Cash, check, all major credit cards, and financing for qualified buyers.

**Are you licensed and insured?**

Yes. We're fully licensed and insured in the state of Michigan. License #[XXXXX].

**What if I'm not home during the appointment?**

As long as we can safely access your HVAC system and you're comfortable with it, we can work while you're not home. Many customers provide garage codes or leave doors unlocked. We'll discuss the details when we schedule your appointment.
