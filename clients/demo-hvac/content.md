## TESTIMONIALS SECTION
*(Insert after "Why Choose Us" or before "Final CTA")*

# **WHAT OUR NEIGHBORS SAY**

**— Mike T., Sterling Heights**

---

### "No games, no pressure — just straightforward service"

"I've used them for two years now for my AC and furnace tune-ups. They show up when they say they will, explain everything clearly, and never try to upsell me. That's rare these days."

**— Jennifer L., Warren**

---

### "Finally, a local company we can trust"

"After getting burned by a big chain that kept pushing expensive add-ons, we found Comfort Breeze. They're honest, their pricing is fair, and they treat you like a neighbor, not a transaction."
