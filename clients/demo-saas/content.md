## Problem/Pain Agitation Section

### Section Headline
**Sound Familiar?**

### Pain Point Card 1
#### Your roadmap lives in one tool, feedback in another, and sprints in a third
You've tried to make it work, but context gets lost in translation. Every handoff is a potential miscommunication.

### Pain Point Card 2
#### You spend hours every week updating stakeholders because no one has visibility
Engineering asks about priorities. Design needs context. Leadership wants status updates. You're a human API between disconnected systems.

### Pain Point Card 3
#### Every "quick sync" turns into a 30-minute alignment meeting
Without a shared source of truth, your calendar fills with meetings that exist solely to answer "what are we building and why?"

### Transition Statement
**You don't need another tool. You need fewer tools that do more.**

---

## Solution Overview Section

### Section Headline
**One Platform. Complete Alignment.**

### Value Statement
ProductFlow gives your team a single source of truth for product planning, feedback management, and sprint execution. See what you're building, why it matters, and who it's for—all in one place.

### Visual Caption
