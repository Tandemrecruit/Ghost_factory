FAIL: [Multiple visual issues detected]

**Specific Problems:**

1. **Text Readability Issues:**
   - Several sections contain text that appears difficult to read due to contrast or color matching
   - Multiple instances of text that may be invisible or nearly invisible against backgrounds (particularly in darker blue sections)

2. **Layout Concerns:**
   - Some sections appear to have inconsistent spacing and alignment
   - Text boxes and content areas show potential overlap in certain mobile viewport areas

3. **Button/CTA Visibility:**
   - Some call-to-action buttons appear to blend with surrounding elements
   - Color contrast may be insufficient for accessibility compliance

4. **Invisible Text Detection:**
   - Dark blue background sections contain text that has severely reduced contrast
   - Multiple instances where text color appears to match or nearly match the background color, making content invisible or barely visible
   - Particularly problematic in the navy/dark blue colored sections with white or light text that may not have sufficient contrast ratio

5. **Professional Appearance:**
   - Overall layout structure is present, but visual hierarchy is compromised by contrast and readability issues
   - The page would fail WCAG accessibility standards due to insufficient contrast ratios

**Recommendation:** Review all text-to-background color contrast ratios, ensure minimum 4.5:1 for normal text and 3:1 for large text per WCAG AA standards.
