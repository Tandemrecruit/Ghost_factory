# Offer Scope â€“ Landing Page Build

## 1. Who This Service Is For

This service is designed for:

- Solo and small/local service businesses
- Who need a **single, focused landing page** for a specific offer
- Whose main goal is to **get more leads, bookings, or purchases** from that page

This is not a full website or brand overhaul. It is a focused, conversion-oriented landing page.

---

## 2. Whatâ€™s Included (Standard Landing Page Package)

The standard package includes:

1. **One landing page**
   - Built in a component-based system (your â€œlanding page factoryâ€)
   - Structured to match the clientâ€™s intake form answers

2. **Up to 5 sections**, for example:
   - Hero section with primary call-to-action
   - Problem / solution section
   - Benefits / features section
   - Social proof / testimonials section
   - Final CTA/footer section

3. **Copy and layout generated + refined** based on:
   - Clientâ€™s intake form answers
   - Internal intake and strategy agents
   - Your manual review and tweaks

4. **One revision round**
   - Client can request changes to copy and light layout (within the agreed scope)
   - All requested changes should be sent in one list where possible

5. **Connection of the primary CTA**
   - Main button wired to one of:
     - A phone number
     - A booking/scheduling link
     - A contact/quote form
     - A checkout/product URL the client already has

6. **Basic mobile and desktop QA**
   - Automated UI/QA agent pass
   - Your manual review across mobile and desktop

## 3. Whatâ€™s Not Included (Out of Scope)

To protect time and scope, the standard package does **not** include:

- Multi-page websites or full site builds
- Complex apps or features (logins, dashboards, user accounts, custom logic)
- Full brand identity or deep brand strategy work
  - (e.g., full logo design process, brand manuals, etc.)
- Custom backend integrations or workflow automation beyond the main CTA
- Ongoing analytics, optimization, or A/B testing (unless added as a separate service)
- Ongoing maintenance or retainers by default

Any work outside this scope is treated as:

- A new project, or
- An add-on service with its own pricing and timeline

---

## 4. Turnaround Expectations

Standard guidelines:

- **Draft delivery:** within _X_ business days after **intake form is submitted** and the project is accepted
- **Revision round:** within _Y_ business days after client sends consolidated feedback
- **Final delivery:** after client approves the draft and pays the remaining 50%

(You can set specific X and Y values based on your availability.)

## 5. Service Versions (Managed vs Self-Hosted)

The landing page build is compatible with two delivery modes:

1. **Managed Hosting** â€“ you host and manage the live page  
2. **Self-Hosted Handoff** â€“ you deliver code and instructions for the clientâ€™s developer

Details for each option are defined in `hosting_policy.md`.

This scope file governs **what the landing page service does and doesnâ€™t include**, regardless of the hosting option selected.
