# Payment, Ownership, and Licensing Policy

This file defines how payments, ownership, and rights to the work product are handled.

---

## 1. Payment Structure (50/50)

Projects use a **two-milestone payment structure**:

1. **Deposit â€“ 50%**
   - Due before any work begins
   - Unlocks:
     - Project slot reservation
     - Access to the full intake form
     - Start of the intake â†’ draft process once the form is submitted

2. **Final Payment â€“ 50%**
   - Due when the draft has been approved and is ready for launch
   - Unlocks:
     - Final deliverables (code and/or deployment)
     - License to use the landing page commercially

No work should be started before the deposit is paid.  
No final deliverables or deployment should occur before the final payment is received.

## 2. Ownership of Work Product

**Before final payment:**

- All work product remains **your IP**, including:
  - Page design and layout
  - Copy and messaging
  - Code and components
  - Any derivative assets created for the page
- The client is granted a **limited, preview-only license**:
  - They may view the draft privately for review and feedback
  - They may not publish, distribute, or commercially use the draft

**After full payment:**

- Upon receipt of the final 50% payment:
  - The client receives a license to use the agreed deliverables for their business
  - Exact license (exclusive vs non-exclusive, ability to reuse generic structures) can be adjusted per client
- You may retain:
  - The right to reuse underlying patterns, layouts, and non-client-specific structures in other projects
  - The right to keep anonymized examples for your portfolio (if agreed in advance)

---

## 3. Preview-Only Phase (Draft Access)

During the draft/revision phase:

- Drafts are hosted on **your infrastructure** (e.g., your domain or staging environment)
- The client receives a **preview URL** for review
- You do **not**:
  - Push code into the clientâ€™s repositories
  - Provide source code files
  - Connect the page to the clientâ€™s live domain

This keeps the draft clearly in â€œevaluation onlyâ€ status until the project is fully paid.

---

## 4. Non-Payment and Abandonment

### 4.1. Before work has started

- If the client pays the deposit but **never submits the intake form**, you may:
  - Offer a partial or full refund at your discretion, or
  - Charge an admin/cancellation fee and refund the remainder
- This should be decided based on how much admin/time has already been spent

### 4.2. After work has started

Work is considered â€œstartedâ€ once:

- The intake form has been submitted and
- You (or your agents) have begun creating the brief, copy, or page

At this point:

- The **deposit becomes non-refundable**
- If the client cancels, you are not obligated to refund the initial 50%

### 4.3. After draft delivery

If the client:

- Receives the draft and
- Fails to provide feedback or pay the final 50% within a reasonable period (e.g., 14â€“30 days),

you may:

- Withdraw draft access (take down the preview)
- Note that the project is closed due to inactivity
- Optionally reuse the general structure as a template in future projects (without using their branding or confidential information)

---

## 5. License Summary (Plain Language)

- **Until full payment:**  
  - You own everything; client can only view drafts privately.

- **After full payment:**  
  - The client is granted a license to use the final landing page for their business as agreed.
  - You may still reuse generic layouts and non-specific structures.

This policy is meant to protect your time and IP while staying fair and clear to the client.
