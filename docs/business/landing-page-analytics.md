# Landing Page Performance & Analytics

## Why we include basic analytics

A landing page is only as good as the results it produces.

As part of your project, we include lightweight, privacy-friendly tracking so you can see how your page is performing in the real world and make informed decisions over time.

This gives both of us clear answers to questions like:

- How many people are visiting the page?
- How many people click the main call-to-action (CTA)?
- How many people actually complete the next step (form, booking, or purchase)?
- Which sections of the page are pulling their weight?

## What we track

We focus on a small set of practical metrics:

### 1. Visits (page views)

Every time someone lands on your page, we count a page view.

This helps answer:

- Are people finding the page?
- Are our traffic efforts working at all?

We do **not** track individual people across different sites. This is about overall traffic and trends, not personal profiles.

### 2. CTA click-through rate (CTR)

Your landing page usually has one primary action, such as:

- “Book a free call”
- “Get a quote”
- “Start application”
- “Order now”

We track how many visitors click that main CTA, and what percentage of total visitors that represents. This is your CTA click-through rate (CTR).

This helps answer:

- Is the page doing a good job getting people to raise their hand?
- Does a new headline, layout, or CTA label improve results?

### 3. Conversions

A “conversion” is the main success event we agree on for your page, for example:

- Completed contact form
- Appointment booked
- Application started or submitted
- Purchase begun or completed

We track how many visitors reach that goal so you can see:

- How often visitors turn into leads or customers
- Whether changes to the page improve or hurt results

### 4. Section-level performance (where useful)

On some projects, we also tag major sections of the page (for example, the hero, pricing section, and testimonial block) so we can see which areas are most closely associated with clicks and conversions.

This helps us refine future versions of the page and make smarter layout decisions.

## How this benefits you

Including this level of tracking means:

- You’re not guessing – you can see what’s actually happening.
- You can see whether small changes (like a new headline or CTA text) move the needle.
- You have simple numbers you can share with partners, managers, or investors if needed.

Over time, it also lets us build a sense of “what tends to work” for businesses like yours so we can keep improving.

## Privacy and data handling

We take a simple, privacy-conscious approach:

- We do **not** collect names, email addresses, phone numbers, or any form contents in analytics.
- We do **not** use this tracking for advertising, remarketing, or selling data.
- We only track anonymous events like “page viewed,” “button clicked,” or “form completed,” along with basic page identifiers.
- Data is used to understand performance and improve your page and similar projects.

If we ever propose adding more advanced tracking (for example, connecting to your existing analytics account), we will discuss it with you first and get your approval.

## Your access to the numbers

How you see the results will depend on your setup and preferences. Common options are:

- A simple summary report after launch (for example, after the first 30 days)
- Periodic check-ins where we review key numbers together
- Access to a lightweight dashboard, if available for your project

If you already have an analytics tool you prefer, we can often align our setup with that so everything is in one place.

## What we need from you

Before we launch, we’ll agree on:

1. **Your primary goal**  
   For example: “Booked calls,” “Completed quote requests,” or “Orders started.”

2. **Your primary CTA**  
   The button or link that matters most for this goal.

Once those are clear, we’ll wire the tracking to match so the numbers you see reflect the outcomes you care about most.
