## 1. Hero

Purpose:  

Hook the right people quickly and give them one clear action.

Elements:

- Headline:
  - Promise a specific outcome:
    - Example idea:  

      "Turn browsers into bookings with a focused landing page"

- Subhead:
  - Clarify who it"™s for and what"™s included:
    - Example idea:  

      "For small, service-based businesses that need a clear, professional page that actually drives calls, inquiries, or bookings."

- Primary CTA:
  - Button text:
    - Example idea: "Start your project" or "Book your landing page"
  - Target action:
    - Scroll to booking/payment section or open a short intake/interest form.

Optional supporting line under the button:

  - "Flat fee, clear process, one revision included."

---

## 2. Who This Is For

Purpose:  

Let the right people recognize themselves.

Content ideas:

- Short intro sentence:
  - "This is for you if you run a small service business and you"¦"
- Bullet list (3"“5 bullets), for example:
  - Don"™t have a landing page you"™re proud to send people to.
  - Are sending paid or organic traffic to a cluttered home page that doesn"™t convert.
  - Feel stuck trying to write your own copy or piece together templates.
  - Want something simple, clear, and focused that makes it easy for visitors to take the next step.

Optional "who this is not for" (1"“3 bullets):

- Not ideal if:
  - You need a complex multi-page website with dozens of pages.
  - You expect unlimited revisions or ongoing daily edits included.
  - You want to run a full brand overhaul before the page is built.

---

## 3. What You Get (Deliverables)

Purpose:  

Spell out the concrete outcomes so it doesn"™t feel vague.

List items (mapped to LP-Standard):

- One conversion-focused landing page
  - Roughly 5"“6 sections tailored to your offer and audience.
- Clear messaging and structure
  - Headline, subheads, body copy, and CTAs written for your business.
- Page layout and build
  - Implemented in a modern, responsive layout that works on desktop and mobile.
- One focused revision round
  - You review the draft, send one list of changes, and I refine it.
- Simple next-step guidance
  - I"™ll show you how we"™ll launch it:
    - Either I host it for you, or
    - I hand everything off to your developer.

Optional small note:

- "This is not a full multi-page website "“ it"™s a focused landing page designed to drive one main action."

---

## 4. How It Works (Process)

Purpose:  

Reduce friction by making the steps feel clear and light.

Section title idea:

- "How it works" or "What the process looks like"

Steps (3"“4):

1) Reserve your spot  

   - "Secure your project with a 50% deposit so I can hold time for you."

2) Fill out a simple form  

   - "You"™ll answer a guided questionnaire about your business, your ideal clients, and your offer."

3) I turn it into a landing page  

   - "I handle the messaging, structure, and build, then send you a draft to review."

4) Review, refine, and launch  

   - "You send one list of changes, I refine the page, and we launch or hand it off."

Keep the tone straightforward; avoid jargon like "wireframes" unless you really need it.

---

## 5. Timeline

Purpose:  

Make the turnaround feel fast but realistic.

Suggested copy:

- "Timeline"
- "Once you complete the intake form, you"™ll receive your first draft within 3"“5 business days."
- "After you send your feedback, I"™ll apply your changes and prepare the final version for launch."

Optional note:

- "If you have a hard deadline (like a campaign start date), mention it when you book and I"™ll confirm if I can meet it."

Later, you can mention rush if you decide to offer it:

- "Need it faster? Ask about rush options."

---

## 6. Pricing

Purpose:  

Be clear and simple. One main price.

Structure:

- Section title: "Pricing" or "Simple flat fee"
- One main price:

  - "Flat fee for a done-for-you landing page: [YOUR PRICE HERE]"

- Underneath, list what that includes:
  - One landing page with ~5"“6 sections.
  - Strategy, copy, and build.
  - One revision round.
  - Basic launch support or handoff.

If you want to hint at hosting without locking exact numbers on day one:

- "Hosting options:"
  - "I can host the page for you for a simple monthly fee."
  - "Or I can hand everything off to your developer if you prefer to host it yourself."

Payment structure (simple version):

- "50% to reserve your project and get the intake form."
- "50% when you approve the final draft, before launch or handoff."

---

## 7. FAQ

Purpose:  

Pre-answer the most common hesitations.

Suggested questions (edit wording later):

- "What if I don"™t know how to describe what I want?"
  - Answer: The form is written in plain language; you just describe your business and your clients, and I handle the structure and wording.

- "Do I need an existing website?"
  - Answer: No. This can be your first page, or it can be a focused page alongside your existing site.

- "What if I need more changes?"
  - Answer: One focused revision round is included. If you need more, we can either scope a small add-on or a follow-up project.

- "Can you connect this to my domain?"
  - Answer: Yes, I can either host it for you and help you point your domain, or prepare everything for your developer to plug into your existing setup.

- "What if I"™m not happy with the draft?"
  - Answer: I use your form responses as the foundation and we refine through the revision round. The goal is to get you a page you feel confident sharing.

---

## 8. Final Call-To-Action

Purpose:  

End with one clear next step.

Content:

- Short recap sentence:
  - "If you"™re ready to have a landing page you"™re not embarrassed to send people to, here"™s the next step."
- Primary CTA button:
  - "Start your project" or "Book your landing page"
- Under the button:
  - One line explaining what happens:
    - "You"™ll reserve your spot with a 50% deposit and get a link to the intake form."

---

## 9. Notes for Implementation (Internal)

When I turn this outline into a real page:

- Keep the page short and skimmable.
- Use:
  - One main CTA repeated in a few places (hero, mid-page, bottom).
  - Simple section headings:
    - "Who this is for"
    - "What you get"
    - "How it works"
    - "Timeline"
    - "Pricing"
    - "FAQ"
- Avoid any mention of:
  - AI
  - automation
  - tools behind the scenes

Clients should just see a clear, simple service with a reliable process and fair price.
