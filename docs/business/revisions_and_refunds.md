# Revisions and Refunds Policy

This file defines how revisions, change requests, and refunds are handled for landing page projects.

---

## 1. Revisions

### 1.1. Included Revisions

The standard landing page package includes:

- **One revision round** after the initial draft

A â€œrevision roundâ€ means:

- The client reviews the draft
- The client sends a consolidated list of changes
- You implement those changes in one pass (within the agreed scope)

### 1.2. What Counts as a Revision (In Scope)

Revisions can include:

- Adjusting headlines, sub-headlines, and body copy
- Swapping out or editing testimonials
- Tweaking colors or small visual accents within the existing design system
- Minor layout adjustments (moving or reordering existing sections/components)
- Fixing typos, clarity issues, and small factual corrections

### 1.3. What Counts as New Scope (Out of Scope)

The following are considered outside of the included revision round and may require a new quote:

- Adding entirely new sections not implied by the original intake
- Changing the primary offer or target audience after the draft is built
- Rebuilding the page for a different product, service, or campaign
- Full redesigns of layout or visual style not based on the original brief
- Major new integrations or functional changes (e.g., complex forms, embedded apps)

When in doubt, you can decide whether a request is a **revision** or **new scope** and communicate that clearly.

---

## 2. Timeline for Revisions

- The client is encouraged to provide revision requests within a set window  
  - e.g., **7 days after draft delivery**
- If no feedback is received within that window:
  - You may consider the draft accepted
  - Any later changes may be treated as a new mini-project

You can adjust this window if needed, but it should be consistent and clearly stated.

## 3. Refund Policy

### 3.1. Before Work Begins

If the client has paid the initial 50% deposit but:

- Has not submitted the intake form, and
- You have not started any work,

you may choose to:

- Offer a partial or full refund, or
- Deduct a small admin fee and refund the rest

This can be evaluated case-by-case.

### 3.2. After Work Begins (Non-Refundable Deposit)

Work is considered â€œbegunâ€ once:

- The client has submitted the intake form, and
- You or your system have started generating the brief, copy, or page

At that point:

- The **initial 50% deposit is non-refundable**

Reason:

- Time has been spent
- Tools and APIs have been used
- The core value (strategy and structure) is already being delivered

### 3.3. After Draft Delivery

Once a draft has been delivered:

- The client is entitled to one included revision round (within scope)
- If the client chooses not to proceed:
  - The deposit remains non-refundable
  - No additional refunds are provided
- If there is a clear error on your side, you can choose to:
  - Offer an additional minor revision, or
  - Offer a partial goodwill credit on a future project (optional)

## 4. Handling Disputes (Internal Guideline)

If a client is unhappy:

1. Clarify whether the request fits within the agreed scope
2. Offer:
   - One more reasonable adjustment within scope, or
   - A clear explanation of what would require a new project or fee
3. Stay polite but firm:
   - The process and policies exist to protect both sides
   - You aim for a good outcome but not unlimited free edits

This policy keeps your time protected while giving clients a fair and understandable revision and refund structure.
