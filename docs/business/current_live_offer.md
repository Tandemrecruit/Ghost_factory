# Current Live Offer â€“ Done-For-You Landing Page

This file defines the ONE public-facing offer Iâ€™m taking live first.  
Everything else (tiers, white-label, branding packs) is internal only for now.

---

## Offer Name (Internal and External)

Working name:

- Done-for-you landing page

Later I can rename it (e.g. â€œLaunch Landing Pageâ€), but the scope stays the same.

---

## Whatâ€™s Included (Mapped to LP-Standard)

This offer maps to my internal LP-Standard tier.

Included:

- One high-converting landing page
- Roughly 5â€“6 sections, for example:
  - Hero: who itâ€™s for, core promise, primary CTA
  - Problem / solution: what pain it solves and how
  - Benefits: 3â€“5 core benefits or outcomes
  - Social proof: testimonials, reviews, or trust elements (if provided)
  - FAQ or process: common questions or â€œhow it worksâ€
  - Final CTA: clear next step with supporting reminder
- Strategy and structure:
  - I turn the intake form answers into a clear offer and page structure
- Copywriting:
  - Headlines, subheads, body copy, and CTA text for the page
- Implementation:
  - Page built in my landing page system (Ghost_factory stack)
- One revision round:
  - One focused round of changes based on consolidated feedback
  - Designed for polishing and aligning, not a full rebuild

Not included (by default):

- Full multi-page website
- Ongoing unlimited edits or content changes
- Complex funnel setups (multi-step forms, automations, etc.)
- Branding overhaul (logo design, full brand guide, etc.)
- Custom integrations beyond basic forms/links unless specifically scoped

---

## Turnaround Promise (Public) vs Internal Reality

Public promise:

- â€œYouâ€™ll receive your first draft within 3â€“5 business days after you submit the intake form.â€

Optional rush (future):

- â€œPriority draft within 2 business daysâ€ for an additional rush fee (25â€“40% of project price).

Internal reality:

- Aim to have a solid draft ready within 24â€“48 hours of completed intake.
- Use the remaining time window for:
  - Buffer around my day jobs and life
  - A second look with fresh eyes
  - Fixing any small layout/copy issues before the client sees it

---

## Pricing (Internal View Only)

Internal anchor:

- This offer = LP-Standard.

Internal target price range:

- Base internal target: around 450 USD per project.
- Floor and ceiling are controlled by:
  - Time estimates (typically 5â€“7 hours of â€œbrain timeâ€ for a standard project),
  - Desired monthly effective hourly rate (e.g. 50â€“75 USD/hr),
  - Add-ons like self-hosted handoff or rush turnaround.

Public pricing (to decide later):

- Likely a single clear number (or â€œstarting atâ€ number), e.g. something like:
  - 4xxâ€“5xx USD for the full landing page.
- Exact numbers and copy will be set when I write the sales page,
  using this file and docs/internal/pricing_model.md as the source of truth.

---

## Payment Structure

Internal rules:

- 50/50 structure:
  - 50% deposit to start (and release the intake form link).
  - 50% on final approval before:
    - Connecting their domain (Managed Hosting), or
    - Delivering self-hosted code/hand-off assets.

- Deposit is non-refundable once:
  - The intake form is submitted and work has clearly begun (intake â†’ strategy â†’ draft).

This is enforced by:

- docs/payment_and_ownership.md
- docs/revisions_and_refunds.md

---

## Hosting Options (How This Offer Connects)

This offer can be combined with:

- Managed Hosting:
  - I host the page and keep it live.
  - Internal target: 25â€“35 USD/month per page.
- Self-Hosted Handoff:
  - Client or their dev handles hosting.
  - Internal handoff fee: +100â€“150 USD on top of the project.

At launch:

- I can keep hosting simple in public copy:
  - â€œI can either host the page for you for a simple monthly fee, or hand everything off to your developer.â€

Details and exact numbers are controlled by:

- docs/hosting_policy.md
- docs/internal/pricing_model.md

---

## Revision Policy (For This Offer)

This offer includes:

- One focused revision round.

Operationally:

- Client sends one consolidated list of changes.
- I apply those changes as long as they are:
  - Consistent with the original goal and intake,
  - Not a complete shift in audience, offer, or visual direction.

Out-of-scope changes (new offer, new audience, full redesign) should be:

- Treated as a new project or paid add-on, based on:
  - docs/revisions_and_refunds.md
  - docs/offer_scope.md

## Why Only One Live Offer for Now

Internal reasoning:

- Keeps my marketing simple:
  - One page to explain
  - One offer to sell
- Makes my pipeline efficient:
  - Everyone goes through the same intake â†’ draft â†’ revision â†’ delivery path.
- Gives cleaner data:
  - Easier to see if the offer, pricing, and process work.

LP-Base and LP-Plus remain:

- Internal-only variants I can use when:
  - Scope is clearly smaller (LP-Base),
  - Scope is clearly larger/complex (LP-Plus),
  - Without exposing multiple choices to clients right now.

When landing pages feel smooth and Iâ€™ve delivered several, I can:

- Decide whether to:
  - Introduce visible tiers, or
  - Add branding starter packs as a second service.
