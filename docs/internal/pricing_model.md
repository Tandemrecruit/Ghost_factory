# Internal Pricing Model – Landing Page Builder

Purpose  
This file is **internal only**. It defines how I price projects so I can:

- Hit a sane effective hourly rate
- Cover tool and hosting costs
- Stay consistent across clients
- Avoid making emotional, one-off pricing decisions

Clients never see this file. Public prices come later.

---

## 1. Constraints and Targets

### 1.1 Time and income goals

- Current availability: ~20 hours/week for all business work (marketing + delivery).
- Realistic build time per landing page (including admin/comms):
  - 4–6 hours once the pipeline is smooth.
- Target effective hourly rate:
  - Short term starter target: **$40–$50/hr**
  - Medium-term target (as portfolio builds): **$60–$75/hr**

That means:

- A typical landing page should **not** be priced under ~**$250** (4–5 hours × $50/hr).
- Healthy target range per project: **$300–$600** depending on complexity.

### 1.2 Costs to remember

Per project, roughly expect:

- AI/API usage: small but real (budget **$3–$10** per project).
- Hosting (managed option): a few dollars/month (rolled into ongoing fee).
- Payment fees: ~3% of project price.

Internal rule:  
Aim for **≥75% gross margin** after direct costs (fees, tools, etc.).

## 2. Core Services and Base Prices (Internal View)

These are internal base prices, not final public names/descriptions.

### 2.1 Landing Pages (Core offers)

- **LP-Base**
  - Internal price: **$300**
  - Scope:
    - 1 landing page
    - Up to 4 sections (Hero + 2–3 supporting sections + footer)
    - One primary CTA wired
    - 1 revision round
  - Intended for:
    - Simple local services, very focused offer
  - Expected time:
    - 4–5 hours total (intake → build → revision)

- **LP-Standard**
  - Internal price: **$450**
  - Scope:
    - 1 landing page
    - Up to 6 sections (Hero, Problem/Solution, Benefits, Social Proof, FAQ or Process, Final CTA)
    - One primary and one secondary CTA
    - 1 revision round
  - Intended for:
    - Most clients; default offer
  - Expected time:
    - 5–7 hours total

- **LP-Plus**
  - Internal price: **$650**
  - Scope:
    - 1 landing page
    - Up to 8 sections (Standard + extra slices like detailed FAQ, comparison, gallery, etc.)
    - Support for more complex CTAs (e.g. segmented CTAs, multiple “paths”)
    - 1 revision round, plus small polish tweaks after launch window
  - Intended for:
    - Higher-touch clients, more complex offers, or higher budgets
  - Expected time:
    - 7–9 hours total

Internal anchor:  
- **LP-Standard = default**.  
- Only go down to LP-Base when the scope is truly simple or for strategic discounts.  
- LP-Plus is the “stretch” offer for more complex work or higher budgets.

---

## 3. Hosting & Maintenance Pricing (Internal)

Two modes:

1. Managed Hosting (I host and manage)  
2. Self-Hosted (Client/dev owns hosting)

### 3.1 Managed Hosting (internal numbers)

Components:

- Base hosting cost: low (e.g. Vercel free/cheap tier), but assume **$5/mo internal** for safety.
- My time:
  - Occasional DNS help and small tweaks.
  - “Be available” budget: a bit of ongoing responsibility.

Internal default:

- **Managed Hosting fee: $25–$35/month per page**
  - Starter anchor: **$25/mo**
  - Future when I’m busier: **$35–$45/mo**

What it covers:

- Live hosting
- Occasional uptime checks
- VERY minor copy tweaks (typo fixes, tiny text edits) within reason

Internal rules:

- Managed hosting is optional; don’t force it.
- No “unlimited tweaks” – keep it to tiny changes.
- Anything bigger than minor edits → quote as a mini-project.

### 3.2 Self-Hosted Handoff (internal numbers)

If the client wants the code to put into their own stack:

- Add a **handoff fee** to cover:
  - Packaging the files
  - Writing a simple README_deploy
  - Answering 1–2 clarifying dev questions

Internal default:

- Add **$100–$150** to the project for self-hosted handoff.
  - Example:
    - LP-Standard ($450) + self-hosted handoff ($100) = **$550 total**

---

## 4. White-Label / Agency Pricing (Internal)

If I ever white-label for agencies:

Internal rule:

- Partner price = **70–80% of my “retail” price**, but:
  - Minimum price floor maintained.
  - They handle client communication and support.

Examples:

- If LP-Standard retail is $450:
  - White-label range: **$315–$360**.
- If they want bulk or repeat work:
  - Lean toward ~75% of retail with clear minimum volume:
    - e.g. “3+ pages per month at $350 each for LP-Standard scope.”

Guardrail:

- Do NOT go below **$300** per page for serious white-label, unless:
  - Scope is heavily constrained, and
  - It’s explicitly treated as low-touch, high-volume work.

---

## 5. Discounts, Rush Fees, and Edge Cases

### 5.1 Discount rules (internal only)

Internal defaults:

- Standard price = LP-Standard for normal clients.
- Allowed discounts:
  - Launch/pilot clients: up to **20% off** LP-Standard.
  - Friends/family or strategically important: up to **30% off** LP-Standard.
- Never discount:
  - Below **LP-Base** floor for that scope.
  - For “exposure” only.

If I discount, I internally record:

- Full price
- Discount applied
- Reason (pilot, friend, case-study, etc.)

### 5.2 Rush fees

If a client wants it faster than my normal turnaround:

- Normal draft turnaround: **5–7 business days** after intake.
- Rush:
  - 2–3 business days draft timeline
  - Add a **rush fee of 25–40%** of the base price.

Example:

- LP-Standard ($450):
  - Rush fee 30% = +$135 → **$585** total.

### 5.3 Scope creep guardrail

If the client changes something big mid-project:

- Swap to new main offer, new audience, or heavy layout changes:
  - That is a **new project or paid add-on**, not “revision.”
- Internal rule:
  - After intake is locked and draft is generated:
    - One revision round is for polishing, not rebuilding.

---

## 6. Internal Pricing Formula

Useful mental model (not shown to clients):

Price ≈ max(
- Minimum viable project fee
- Target hourly rate × estimated hours,
) rounded to a clean price ending in 0 or 5.

Internal reference numbers:

- Minimum viable fee (for one-off landing page):
  - **$300** for LP-Base
- Target hourly:
  - **$50/hr** starter target
  - **$60–$75/hr** as brand and systems mature

Examples:

- Simple local service, few sections:
  - Estimate: 4.5 hours × $50/hr = $225 → round up to **$300** (LP-Base).
- Standard offer with richer content:
  - Estimate: 6.5 hours × $50/hr = $325 → falls into **LP-Standard $450** (gives margin and breathing room).
- Complex or high-value offer:
  - Estimate: 8 hours × $60/hr = $480 → near LP-Plus territory at **$650**.

## 7. How This Connects to Income Goals (Internal Sanity Check)

Ballpark only, to keep perspective.

If average project value is **$450** (mix of LP-Base and LP-Standard):

- 2 projects/month:
  - ~**$900/month**
- 3 projects/month:
  - ~**$1,350/month**
- 4 projects/month:
  - ~**$1,800/month**

With 20 hours/week available:

- 3 landing pages/month (plus some marketing time) is realistic.
- Hitting 3–4 projects/month gets close to “replace one job” territory when combined with managed hosting retainers.

---

## 8. Negotiation Guardrails (Internal Only)

When talking numbers, I keep these in mind:

- Anchor with **LP-Standard** as “normal” for most serious clients.
- Downshift to **LP-Base** if:
  - Very simple project, or
  - Strategic/pilot client with limited budget.
- Upshift to **LP-Plus** when:
  - More complex funnel
  - Multiple audience segments
  - Heavier copy or sections

Red flags:

- If someone pushes for:
  - Huge scope + very low budget
  - Multiple revision rounds “included”
  - Ongoing changes “for free”

…then I either:

- Sharpen the scope (reduce what’s included), or
- Politely decline.

---

## 9. To-Do: Public-Facing Pricing Later

This internal model is not what I publish directly. Later, I’ll:

- Turn LP-Base / LP-Standard / LP-Plus into friendly package names.
- Adjust numbers slightly for psychological pricing (e.g. $297, $475, $650).
- Decide what I show:
  - Exact prices, or
  - “Starting at” with a range.

For now, I use this file as the source of truth when I quote anyone.

---

## 10. Turnaround & Hourly Sanity (Internal Only)

### 10.1 Public vs internal timeline

Public promise (what clients see):

- “You’ll receive your first draft within 3–5 business days after you submit the intake form.”
- Optional rush offer:
  - “Priority draft within 2 business days” with a 25–40% rush fee.

Internal reality (how I run it):

- Aim to have a solid draft ready within 24–48 hours of a completed intake.
- Use the extra time for:
  - Buffer (day jobs, life, tool issues)
  - A second read-through with fresh eyes
  - Fixing any small layout or copy issues before sending

Key idea: the 3–5 day window is a reliability buffer, not a promise that I am “actively working” all that time.

---

### 10.2 How to think about hourly rate

I do NOT adjust prices based on how fast a single project runs.

Instead:

- I track **total hours per month** across:
  - Delivery – active client projects
  - Pipeline & tools – Ghost_factory, scripts, fixes
  - Marketing & sales
  - Admin & overhead
- I track **total revenue per month** from:
  - Landing page projects
  - Hosting/maintenance
  - Any add-ons

Monthly effective hourly rate:

- real_hourly = total_revenue_this_month / total_hours_this_month

Internal rule:

- Pricing stays anchored to a target **monthly** effective hourly (e.g. $50–$75/hr).
- I do not drop prices just because:
  - “This one page only took 3 hours.”
- If my **monthly** effective rate is much higher than target for several months in a row:
  - I can either:
    - Raise my income goal, or
    - Experiment with slightly lower “starter” pricing to fill capacity,
  - But I never do knee-jerk discounts based on one unusually fast project.

---

### 10.3 Guardrails for automation and pricing

- Automation belongs to me; it is not a reason for the client to pay less.
- Clients are paying for:
  - Clear strategy and messaging
  - A page that is structured and written to convert
  - Me handling the process and tech for them
- Automation’s job:
  - Reduce my stress and manual effort
  - Increase consistency
  - Improve my effective hourly rate over time

Internal rules:

- Always price as if a standard project is 5–7 hours of “brain time,” even when automation helps.
- Never quote below:
  - LP-Base minimum, or
  - My minimum viable project fee, just because “the system is fast.”
- Timeline promises (3–5 business days, 2-day rush) stay stable even if the system gets faster; improvements increase margin, not decrease price.

---

## 11. Launch Configuration: Single Live Offer (Internal Only)

At launch, I will only have ONE public-facing landing page offer.

- Public live offer: LP-Standard
- Internal-only variants:
  - LP-Base = quiet “simple discount / stripped scope” tier
  - LP-Plus = quiet “complex scope / premium” tier

External positioning at launch:

- I sell a single, flat-fee “Done-for-you landing page” offer.
- Scope (mapped to LP-Standard):
  - 1 conversion-focused landing page
  - ~6 sections (Hero, Problem/Solution, Benefits, Social Proof, FAQ/Process, Final CTA)
  - One primary and one secondary CTA
  - 1 revision round
  - Draft delivery in 3–5 business days after intake form submission

Internal rules:

- All early clients go through the LP-Standard offer by default.
- LP-Base is used quietly when:
  - Scope is truly simple, or
  - I want to offer a strategic/pilot discount without collapsing margins.
- LP-Plus is used quietly when:
  - The project is clearly more complex (multiple segments, heavier copy, advanced structure),
  - And I need more budget to keep my hourly sane.

Branding starter packs:

- Branding work is NOT a live public offer at launch.
- I only consider branding as:
  - A future Product #2, after landing pages run smoothly,
  - Or a one-off custom quote for perfect-fit clients.
