# Decisions Inbox

Legend:
- [NOTE]     â€“ brain dump, observations, â€œmight matter laterâ€
- [PROPOSAL] â€“ suggested decision or rule change (model or human)
- [DECISION] â€“ approved decision ready to be logged as a D-XXXX (human-only)

Only Ryan should change a bullet to [DECISION].
The Decisions Scribe only promotes [DECISION] items into the Decisions Log.
