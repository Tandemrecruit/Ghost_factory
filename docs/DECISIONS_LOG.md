Summary: Production-grade pipeline for paid client deliverables
Details:
- Python in `automation/**` must be fully typed on public interfaces.
- Enforce robust error handling + logging for anything that touches client output.
- Tests must cover both happy path and main failure modes that affect deliverables.
Rationale:
- Tool emits paid client work; reliability and debuggability are mandatory.
Impact:
- `automation/**`, `tests/**`, CLAUDE.md, CodeRabbit rules, GOVENANCE.md.
